<h1 class="topofpage">Internet Censorship</h1>

<p>
I found the <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/magazine/23google.html">China-Google
Censorship</a> article interesting.  But I wonder how much of a
problem is censorship really.  The Internet is inherently
decentralized.  That makes censorship very difficult in reality.  The
reason China is able to get away with it is because the endpoint of
the content sits in a single place.  That is, if you want to search
for "illegal material"  on google which China is censoring, you have to go to
google's home page.  This is a single point of access which is easy to
censor.
</p>

<p>
But think of all the technologies out there which are used to download
copyrighted material.  Peer-to-peer technologies came out almost a
decade ago, and what's out there now, I'm sure is far more
sophisticated (i2hub, gnutella, kazaa, bit torrents).  Now I don't download either legal or illegal audio or video
on the Internet.  So, I'm not familiar with how any of these
technologies work.  But I'm sure search engines might be able to learn
a lesson from the success of some of these technologies.
</p>

<p>
Here's one idea I had.  After reading the article, it took me a few
minutes to think of this.  I'm sure there are much better ways to
circumvent censorship.  Suppose I make essentially a front-end to
google, and I call it theroaminginternet.com.  The first thing I would
do is encrypt the entire site.  That way it's impossible to filter
based on content.  The government will still know who's using my site,
but not what they're looking at.
</p>

<p>
OK, but if theroaminginternet were to become popular, it would
probably just get blocked altogether.  Fair enough.  The next step I
would take is to set up a simple API so other sites could easily
access my own.  They would become a front-end to my site, and I would
pay them a percentage of the money I earn to encourage them to do so.
If I write all the software and make it easy to set up, it would only
take a few hours of their time and about $6 for a domain.  Now I have
decentralized google and made it nearly impossible to track or filter
in any way.  Anyone could set up a new domain at any time for very
little money.
</p>

<p>
Of course there is still an obvious problem.  How are people supposed
to know about these new domains that are coming and going?  You would
have to make a web site that lists the domains.  There would have to
be software that would continually update the web site, but that's not
too hard to do.  There might also be user feedback, so it would be
easy to know which sites were being blocked at the current time.  Of
course this site could be easily blocked; so it too would have to be
accessible through many domains.
</p>

<p>
You may be thinking this is just too complicated.  No one is going to
put the effort into finding the lists of unblocked domains so they can
find a front-end to theroaminginternet so they can perform an
uncensored search.  But consider if even .1 to 1 percent of the
population is willing to put in a little effort.  This is millions of
people.  There is no way the government would have any hope of
tracking and blocking such people.  According to the article, much of
the current censorship is done via self-censorship by using intimidation and
fear.  They simply don't have the resources.
</p>

<p>
All it takes is a small percentage of people who know how to access
information.  If a less knowledgeable person wanted to do an
uncensored search, he could just ask a friend.  And such information tends
to spread almost instantly on the Internet.  Not to mention filtering
web sites would become very difficult if too many domains were set
up.  Every single packet that passed through "The Great Firewall of
China" would have to be compared against thousands or
tens-of-thousands of blacklisted domains.  And it would be a
constantly growing list.  It could create serious delay problems for
the Chinese Internet.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, my point is, censorship is only an illusion.  Anyone who wants
to find information should be able to so without leaving the country
and without Chinese officials knowing what that material is.
