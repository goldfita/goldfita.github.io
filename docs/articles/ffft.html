<h1 class="topofpage">Understanding the FFT</h1>

<p>
Starting out learning something new, there's always that initial
cloudiness we have until things finally click.  They may click in three
minutes, or it might take ten years.  It just depends on the level of
difficulty.  This is especially troublesome with math.  Remember the
first time you saw the definition of a Fourier Transform or the
discrete version?  You probably thought, like me, what in God's name
is that?  And the sixth or seventh time you saw it, you were probably
still thinking, what in God's name is that?
</p>

<p>
Maybe your professor made a joke about how Fourier (or Laplace) was clearly on
drugs when he came up with his transform.  Unfortunately, that doesn't
help me.  I don't use drugs.  And even if I did, I doubt I would see
the same thing as Fourier.  The really awesome professors will really
try to make you understand.  First you'll get the definition.  Then they'll show you how to
get there.  I've seen the derivation a few times, and at one point I
think I actually understood all the steps.
</p>

<p>
But being able to follow the steps doesn't give you any intuition about
what it all means.  The good professors will keep going.  They'll
explain the time-frequency concepts and give relevant examples that
help elucidate what all the crazy math actually means.  They'll cover
every little step in detail.  If there's any hand-waving, it will be
done so that you don't even notice.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't until my senior year of college that the definition of the
DFT (and the continuous form) started to make sense to me.  Something a
professor said in my image compression class finally clicked.  It was
this, along with my understanding of correlation and orthogonal
functions that finally lifted the fog (a little).
</p>

<p>
Take a look at the
definition.  Forget about the complex part and treat the exp as a sin
or cos.  (I'm hand-waving over 90% of the details because I don't
understand that well, but you should see the basic idea.)  For each
summation, you compute one frequency bin.  This calculation is
essentially a correlation of the input signal and the frequency you're
calculating.  Notice, one index in the exp traverses the input
signal.  That's the correlation.  The other index determines the
frequency you're comparing the signal against.  There's also a
normalizing factor for the discrete version; ignore that too.
</p>

<p>
Basically, for each frequency bin, you're comparing the signal against
that frequency.  That's all the summation is doing.  It's just the
correlation at zero lag.  If there is a strong signal component at
that frquency, you'll get a large number in that frequency bin.  If
there's no signal power, the function is uncorrelated with a sinusoid at that
frequency.  You don't have to worry about the sinusoid correlating
with other frequencies in the signal.  One of the reasons sinusoids
are chosen as the basis set is because they're orthogonal at integer
multiples of the lowest frequency.  So the frequency of interest can
only correlate with the signal if there is signal power at that
frequency.  That's it.  One way to think about it is that you're correlating the
signal at each frequency of interest (at orthogonal frequencies).
</p>

<p>
It makes so much more sense when you can look at the definition from
more than one angle.  Another way to boost understanding is by
increasing the level of abstraction or complexity.  It's similar to
how professors give difficult homework problems but easy test
problems.  The assumption is that if you were able to solve the hard
problems, the test problems should be easy.  If you've learned the
quadratic formula, completing the square, and Newton's Method of root
finding, solving x^2+2x+1 the way they taught you in 7th grade should
be obvious by now.
</p>

<p>
If you want to understand more about the DFT, learn some of the
variants.  There are about a hundred of them, and they're pretty much
all related.  But there are also generalizations.  Take the
Fractional DFT, for example.  It turns out you can actually take a
non-integer transform.  What the heck is that?  I'll explain in a
second.
</p>

<p>
Try this: take the DFT of a real-valued sequence.  Then take it
again.*  You should get the original sequence time reversed.  Hm,
that's kind of neat.  Ok, now take it two more times (that's four
DFTs).  Wow, you're right back to where you started.  I guess that
should be obvious.  Now start from the beginning and take the DFT
once.  Take the conjugate and then take the DFT again.  Look at that.
You're right back where you started but with only two DFTs this time.
This is a trick you can use to get the Inverse DFT using just a
conjugate and the DFT.  They'll tell you it's because of conjugate
symmetry.  But there's another reason.
</p>

<p>
You can actually think of taking the DFT as moving through
time-frequency space.  If you take it once, you go from the time
domain to the frequency domain.  If you then take the inverse you move
back to the time domain.  If instead, you take the DFT again, you end
up back on the time domain, but you're on the other side; so, the axis
is reversed.  The little figure below demonstrates.  T_ and F_ are
time and frequency reversed respectively.
</p>

<pre>
        F
        |  &lt;-^
        |    | (T -> F)
T_------|------T
        |
        |
        F_
</pre>

<p>
So now you see why four DFTs gets you back to where you started.  What
about the conjugate method?  Because of conjugate symmetry, taking the
conjugate effectively flips the axis.  Thus it's like taking the DFT
twice.  Try this out in matlab.  Move back and forth between the
different domains with FFT and IFFT.
</p>

<p>
Think of taking the DFT twice as DFT^2.  The ^2 means applying the
operator twice and has nothing to do with squaring the signal.  Then
x[n] = DFT^4 x[n].  What about the space in between?  You can actually
take DFT^.3.  The result is something that is between time and
frequency.  There are some interesting applications of moving to this
more generalized transform.  But it's not just a math quirk.  When you
optically transform an image, the signal passes through all the
fractional transforms on its way from the time domain to the frequency
domain.
</p>

<p>
But I've gotten off track.  The point is that once you spend some time
understanding the generalized DFT, the one that everyone else is using
makes more sense.  If you were really to study it in depth, you would
probably have a much deeper understanding.  Unfortunately, the level
of abstraction and complexity is a good one to two orders of magnitude
higher.  I read the first few chapters of <a

width="1" height="1" alt="" />.  It's not easy stuff.  But look at the
insight you've gained from this brief discussion!
</p>

<p>
<span class="bold">*</span>The DFT isn't quite a unitary transform; so, you have to divide the
IDFT by the length of the input to get back to the original.  So treat
every other DFT as the IDFT and divide by another N for each
additional two.  Also, remember that the negative frequency bins come
after the positive ones.  And for reasons I don't fully understand,
the DC component is not a part of the axis flipping.  If you try this,
ignore the first element and look at the rest for the reversal.
