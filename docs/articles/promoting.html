<h1 class="topofpage">Promoting My Web Page</h1>
<p>
My web site has page rank 3 according to Google.  But that's only the
front page.  The rest of them have no page rank.  So, I thought I'd
try promoting my web site a little.  My first stab at this was Google
adwords.  There isn't an enormous amount of content on my site, but
there should be enough to get at least a handful of links.  It costs
five dollars to sign up.  You get to set the cost per click (starting
at as little as a penny), the maximum cost per day, and the key words
that activate the ad.  You can even set the CPC for each individual
key word.  Some of the more popular keywords don't activate without a
high enough CPC.  The higher the CPC, the better the position of the
ad.</p>
<p>
There is also a traffic estimator. But I didn't get even remotely
accurate estimates.  For the first several days, I targeted the
Research Triangle Park area.  I only got three impressions, and no
clicks.  It jumped to 27 one night - then nothing for a few days.  So,
I changed the target to be the whole country.  But still there was no
activity for at least a day.  Then it jumped to 630 impressions.  And
still no clicks.  However, today I noticed there is a commercial
website carrying my ad.  And Google sees it as a back link to my site.
It appears as if the link is hard coded in the page somehow.  It's
always there every time I search for <a
href="http://www.Google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=signalsguru&amp;btnG=Search">signalsguru</a>.
I'm not sure why that is at this point.  My ad also comes up
consistently if I search for <a
href="http://www.Google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=digital+signal+processing&amp;btnG=Search">Digital
Signal Processing</a> which is pretty amazing.  I guess it's a small
field.</p>
<p>
For some reason I couldn't get to Google AdWords from my machine at
work all day.  I just logged in, and there have now been 2105
impressions.  And I got 5 clicks.  That's a very low hit rate.  But
I'm not selling anything; so, my ad isn't very exciting.  At this
point I'm thinking my front page isn't very useful.  So, I've changed
some of the keywords to point to my <a
href="http://www.signalsguru.net/projects/thesis/thesis_page.html">thesis</a>
page.

This is going to take a more aggressive approach.  Yesterday I did a
little research into link exchange/buying/selling.  There are many
link exchange sites with various business models.  Many of them seem
too expensive to me.  I signed up for the free <br /><br />

<a href="http://monsterlinkswap.com">MonsterLinkSwap.com</a> Trade
links quickly and easily with thousands of other willing web sites!
Our link exchange process saves countless hours in the link trade
process to let you focus on what's important on your
website!<br /><br />

Unfortunately, it's just a directory.  You can search for other sites
that want to do a link exchange.  So I searched and found <br /><br />

<a href="http://www.dj-equipment-supplies.com">Pro Audio Mastering
Software &amp; Music Editing Programs</a>. Build your home recording
studio with pro audio mastering and music editing software.<br />
</p>
<p>
All I have to do now is email them and ask for a link.  You can check
their partners page and see if they gave me one.  This page is going
to be my link exchange page.  If you would like to get a link, email
me what to post and the web page with my link.  I won't link to
unrelated sites, however.  Yours should be in some way related to mine.  You should use the following.
<br /><br />
<span class="bold">Title:</span> SignalsGuru<br />
<span class="bold">Link:</span> http://www.signalsguru.net<br />
<span class="bold">Description:</span> My writings about programming and Digital Signal Processing.

<h2>Links</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.voice-over-internet.info">VOIP - Voice Over Internet Protocol</a> - Internet Voice also known as Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a technology that allows you to make telephone calls using a broadband  Internet connection instead of a regular phone line.

So it's been a little while, and I thought I'd make an update.  First,
I'm adding a link to my <a
href="http://www.colorgarden.org">friend's</a> page.  By the way, from
what I've read, one way links (to you) are better for your page rank
than having pages that point back to the sites that point to them.  I don't know 
if that's true, but it would make sense.  Having sites that point to each 
other often occurs during a link exchange.  And link exchanges somewhat defeat the 
original idea of using a citation based search engine scheme.
</p>
<p>And speaking of link exchanges, be careful of what link exchange sites you give 
information to.  The last one I signed up with was a directory.  It allows you to 
solicit others for a link exchange.  I've been getting spammed with requests for 
link exchanges from sites about viagra and penis extension.  I am NOT giving them a 
link.  (Read this page, darn it.)</p>

<p>
I've learned a little bit more since I last wrote this.  First, I
never got links from the few sites I emailed.  (But I'll leave their
links anyway.)  I don't get many clicks from my AdWords ads even
though some searches bring up my ad right on Google's front page.  I
think part of the reason is that the words "Digital Signal Processing"
don't actually show up anywhere in my ad.  If you've ever paid any
attention to Google's ads, they bold the relevant keywords.  That
makes the ad stand out more.  I also don't have a very interesting ad.
But, hey, I'm not selling anything -- what should I put there?</p>

<p>
This is another update.  For a few months I tried making helpful
postings in Usenet with my link in my signature.  I still get traffic
from those links, but it's not very much.  The very first time I made
a post to slashdot, however, my traffic tripled or quadrupled.  And it
has continued to increase even though my page rank hasn't changed.  It may
have been a coincidence, but I'm not sure.  There aren't many people
reading comp.dsp.  But there are a lot of people who read
slashdot.
