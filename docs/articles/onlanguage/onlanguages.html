It's finally happened.  I've found myself muttering under my breath:
darn, this would be easy in Lisp.  But C isn't Lisp.  And neither are
most other languages.  However, that doesn't mean Lisp is the only
right way to program.  It also doesn't mean features not implemented
in your language can't be approximated.  But as we all know:

<p>
The other day I started reading up on Objective Caml.  OCaml allows
you to switch between an imperative and functional style of
programming.  This is nice because, as the OCaml advocates will tell
you, strong support for recursion and complex abstract data types
makes it great for writing compilers, and, indeed, functional
programming is good for many other things too.  But the functional
style is not good for everything.  It depends on what you're doing.
In many cases, recursion doesn't make sense.  The straight forward
imperative style is better and easier to understand.
</p>

<p>
The OCaml guys will give you a long list of benefits over other
languages, just as with all language supporters.  There are a few
things in particular that I like.  It compiles to native code, yet it
still has an interpreter.  And they claim the OCaml compiler generates
some of the fastest code around, falling somewhere between a C and C++
compiler.  OCaml has garbage collection and exceptions.  It is a
fairly high level language and it can't crash, even as compiled code.
It's just amazing that it can be such a high level language, yet still
run faster than C++.  I haven't written any programs (beyond a few
lines) yet, but I will definitely have to try it out in the future.
</p>

<p>
My article on <a href="../cexample/callocmem.html">C memory
management</a> discussed the limits of how far you can push C to be
object oriented.  My point was not that you can turn C into C++
without the C++ compiler.  In fact, I highly recommend you don't do
what I did in that article.  I was trying to demonstrate that proper memory
management and data handling techniques naturally lead to an object
oriented type design.  The other point was that frequently you don't
need all the power of advanced OO languages.  Some very basic data
structures and function pointers are often enough.
</p>

<p>
I've read that Linux kernel developers messed around with C++ for
kernel programming, and it just didn't work out.  I don't know much
about OSes, but I couldn't imagine using C++ for something like that.
I believe I mentioned before that I don't feel C++ is a very good
language, period.  Perhaps it was a good experiment, but it's served
its purpose.  For the little bit of extra benefit you get over C,
it adds far too much complexity.  It's just too heavy a language for
OS stuff in my mind.  Maybe in some rare circumstances the power of
objects in combination with having low level machine access makes C++
a good choice.  But you have to remember that most high level languages let
you write modules in C.  And if OCaml really is so wonderful and fast,
why not just choose it over C++?
</p>

<hr />

<p>
So first I want to show you how low level constructs give you power.
When I first started programming in Qbasic, I used a lot of gotos.  In
fact, I doubt I knew what a subroutine was.  Until recently I can't
remember ever using a goto in C, and I've been using it for ten plus
years (on and off).  And the reason is precisely because someone said
if I use gotos, my code will look like spaghetti.  But just as
imperative programming is not inherently bad, neither are gotos.  It's
all in how you use them.  You've probably seen code similar to the
following pseudo-code many times.
</p>

<pre>
void ugly_mess()
{
    //allocate resources
    while() {
        for() {
            for() {
                //disgustingly ugly code
            }
        }
    }
    //deallocate resources
    return SUCCESS;
}
</pre>

<p>
Often in these situations, there is a need to exit from inside one of
the inner loops.  You might have multiple exit points in several
different levels of nested loops.  And you can't just return because
you have to free the resources.  One option you have is to free the
resource in the loop and return from there.  But this is just ugly and
asking for trouble.  And it gets really bad if you have to do it in
multiple places.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
void ugly_mess()
{
    //allocate resources
    while() {
        for() {
            for() {
                //disgustingly ugly code
                if(cond1) {
                    //deallocate resources
                    return FAIL;
                }
            }
            if(cond2) {
                //deallocate resources
                return FAIL;
            }
        }
        if(cond3) {
            //deallocate resources
            return FAIL;
        }
    }
    //deallocate resources
    return SUCCESS;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now it's even more impossible to read, and you're just asking for a
memory leak or to forget to close a file or release a mutex.  Another
option is to mess with break and continue.  And still another is to
set flags and possibly restructure the loops.  I've probably done all
three, and even worse, combinations of these techniques, leading to an
incomprehensible, difficult-to-test mess.
</p>

<p>
But now consider what you can accomplish with a goto.  Place a cleanup
label at the end of the function and direct all exit points there.  A
few different possible idioms are:
</p>

<pre>
void ugly_mess1()
{
    //allocate resources
    //code

ugly_mess1_cleanup:
    //free resources
    return SUCCESS;
}


void ugly_mess2()
{
    //allocate resources
    //code
    //free resources

    return SUCCESS;
ugly_mess2_cleanup:
    //free resources
    return FAIL;
}

void ugly_mess3()
{
    //allocate resources
    //code
    //free resources

    return SUCCESS;
ugly_mess3_cleanup1:
    //free resources
    return FAIL1;
ugly_mess3_cleanup2:
    //free resources
    return FAIL2;
ugly_mess3_cleanup3:
    //free resources
    return FAIL3;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now in the loop, you would only need a test condition and a goto.  The
goto acts similar to a return, but it cleans up the resources before
quitting.  It's just that it's done outside the loop.  In the third
case, I've created something like a jump table for failures.  It would
be nice if you could do the cleanup work after the return, but I don't
see any way that C is going to let you get away with this.  Also,
notice the way I named my labels so that there can't be any conflicts.  I
also layed out what I believe would be common idioms for solutions to
this type of problem.  So you should be able to immediately see what
the code is doing if it is implemented in this way.  No spaghetti
here!
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Finally I've gotten to the best part -- the reason that initially
prompted me to write this.  There is this problem that frequently
plagues my C code.  I, at last, reached the point where I decided to
really try and come up with a solution.  If you are familiar with the
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) school of thought, you might have some
distaste for duplicate code.  The Ruby/Rails followers really like to
keep their code DRY.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that you have some code (or maybe lots) in several nearly
identical functions.  But each function has some subtly different
code.  It might be that each function calls a different function, and
that's the only difference.  Or it might be that there is just some
small region of code that is different.  I'll only consider the first
case since you can always transform the second case into the first.
What you want to do is factor out all the duplicate code into a
generalized function.  The trouble is this isn't easy in C.  Take a
look.  (You might want to download the full three examples - <a
href="cnormal.c">1</a> <a href="cmacros.c">2</a> <a
href="cclosures.c">3</a>).
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo0</span>()
{
    codeA();
    puts("<span class="flsf">no parameters in foo0</span>");
    codeB();
}

<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo1</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">f1</span>)
{
    codeA();
    printf("<span class="flsf">f1==%d in foo1\n</span>",f1);
    codeB();
}

<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo2</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">f1</span>, <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">f2</span>)
{
    codeA();
    printf("<span class="flsf">f1==%d f2==%s in foo2\n</span>",f1,f2);
    codeB();
}

<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">main</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    foo0();
    foo1(5);
    foo2(10,"<span class="flsf">a string</span>");
    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
The functions codeA() and codeB() could be anything.  They don't need
to be functions.  The goal is to factor all the identical code out of
foo0, foo1, and foo2 and into a single function.  One way I have done
this is to use macros.  (And keep in mind every example is a little
different.)  The C preprocessor lets you get away with some wickedly
evil stuff.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flpf">#define</span> <span class="flfnf">general_foo</span>(<span class="flvnf">foo</span>) \
    codeA();             \
    foo;                 \
    codeB();

<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo0</span>()
{
    puts("<span class="flsf">no parameters in foo0</span>");
}

<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo1</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">f1</span>)
{
    printf("<span class="flsf">f1==%d in foo1\n</span>",f1);
}

<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo2</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">f1</span>, <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">f2</span>)
{
    printf("<span class="flsf">f1==%d f2==%s in foo2\n</span>",f1,f2);
}

<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">main</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    general_foo(foo0());
    general_foo(foo1(5));
    general_foo(foo2(10,"<span class="flsf">a string</span>"));
    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Although this is ugly, I have, in some sense, succeeded.  I now only need
to change the code in one place.  But the code duplication still
exists in the compiled code, never mind the fact that it's now a little
harder to follow and debug.  The extra code problem is more an issue
of speed than space; big programs generally run slower.  There is a
very limited amount of cache near the processor.  This is the cache
that runs at the processor's clock.  The rest of it is far slower.  If
your program has to cycle through a lot of code, it's going to slow
things down.
</p>

<p>
OK, what next?  Closures!  The idea is this.  I want to create a
general foo function that calls the fooX functions.  This is simple
enough with a function pointer.  But my functions take different
parameters and a variable number of them.  Imagine if I could pack up
the parameters with the function and send both wherever I wanted.
That's a closure.  You can't do this in C; you can only send a pointer
to the function.  But to give you a better idea, let's say I modified
the compiler so that it let me place the variables (the environment)
right before the function in memory and then get a pointer to the
function.  That environment would then become parameters to the
function instead of passing them in the normal way.  They're, in some
sense, a part of the function.  Unfortunately, you can't do this and it
wouldn't work with threads.  Perhaps another attempt would be to
somehow pass the parameters around with the pointer and then pass the
address of the pointer to the function.  Obviously, you wouldn't
actually try to implement any of this.  I'm just trying to give you
the idea.
</p>

<p>
Although I can't actually create a closure, I can get close enough to
come up with a semi-solution to this problem.  One thing you can do
(without changing the compiler) is rewrite the fooX functions so that
they take only a single void pointer as a parameter.  Then pass a
pointer to a struct containing all the parameters to fooX to the
general foo function.  The general foo function will pass it to fooX,
which will know exactly what to do with it.
</p>

<p>
There are two problems with this.  The first is that you have to pack
the data into a struct and pass it to general_foo.  There is no way
around this.  It's the closest you can get to a closure.  You have to
pass both the function pointer and the data separately.  The next problem is that
you'll have to create a special, one-use struct for every different
list of parameters.  And, really, these parameters don't belong
in a struct together.  They probably have nothing in common.
</p>

<p>
So, I'm going to make one more modification and then show the code.
Instead of packing parameters into structs, I'm going to let
general_foo take a variable number of parameters.  One of those
parameters will be an option parameter that allows you to select the
function you want.  Unfortunately this requires you to alter
general_foo every time you add a fooX.  But it's the best I've come up
with so far.  The code duplication is removed at the cost of a little
bit of an ugly conditional.
</p>


<pre class="code">
<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">general_foo</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span> (*<span class="flfnf">foo</span>)(), <span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">opt</span>, ...)
{
    <span class="fltf">va_list</span> <span class="flvnf">argp</span>;

    codeA();
    va_start(argp,opt);
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(opt == 0)
        foo();
    <span class="flkf">else</span> <span class="flkf">if</span>(opt == 1)
        foo(va_arg(argp,<span class="fltf">int</span>));
    <span class="flkf">else</span> <span class="flkf">if</span>(opt == 2) {
        <span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">arg1</span> = va_arg(argp,<span class="fltf">int</span>);
        <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">arg2</span> = va_arg(argp,<span class="fltf">char</span> *);
        foo(arg1,arg2);
    }
    va_end(argp);
    codeB();
}

<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">main</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    general_foo(foo0,0);
    general_foo(foo1,1,5);
    general_foo(foo2,2,10,"<span class="flsf">a string</span>");
    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
</pre>

<p>
The nasty chunk of code between code blocks A and B is where the
closure would have been executed.  In C, you have to make up for it
with some special support logic, unless you use the void pointer to a
struct (which requires defining new structs).
</p>

<p>
I have only a few more comments.  There are a few things I hate
dealing with in C.  One of those is memory management.  It would be
nice if there was a slightly higher level C.  I'm not talking about
C++.  I'm thinking optional garbage collection, strings, array bounds checking,
and possibly exceptions and closures.  So I could optionally
enable/disable garbage collection and array bounds checking.  In most
cases you would probably want to use automatic memory management.
Maybe there are a few places where you want to do it manually for some
reason.  Perhaps you could have that option of using either or both.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that if you have the option of using these advanced features, then
it's harmless in adding them to the language (or creating a slightly
different language).  Certain language features will inevitably effect
the entire language.  For example, a garbage collector that runs
asynchronously will have a performance effect on every other
construct.  But features that don't impact one another can't hurt.  If
you don't find them useful, don't use them.
</p>

<p>
In the past I thought that many language features were probably
unnecessary.  I now feel this is almost never true, except maybe in
some cases with very poorly chosen features.  When you've been working
in a language for a long time, you find good reasons to use those
features.  Eventually, you become good at knowing exactly when to use
them.  And as I alluded to in the first paragraph, you also get good at
knowing when to use those features in languages that don't even support them.
