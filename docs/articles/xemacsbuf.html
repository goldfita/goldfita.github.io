<h1 class="topofpage">Maneuvering the Xemacs Buffer</h1>

<p>
You are sitting in your cubicle admiring the perfect weather outside,
waiting for your boss to bring in the new client.  Everything is going
just swell.  Then it happens.  A glitch occurs in the space-time
continuum.  The vortex rips through your masterful work and the work
of an infinite number of quantum copies of you in parallel universes.
Bits of code are scattered through the infinite universes.
Your binary is wrecked beyond repair.  The code is intermixed with
the less sophisticated work of your Dopplegangers in parallel worlds.
</p>

<p>
Your boss had told you if anything goes wrong with the demo, she'll wave her magic
wand and turn you into a frog and revoke the health insurance clause
from your contract.  A frog?  How are you going to get home?
Nevermind that.  What are you going to tell your wife about the
the family health insurance plan?  You know how she gets.
</p>

<p>
You can hear footsteps and chatter in the hall.  Oh my God, they're
here!  It's over.  You can feel the sheer panic tearing through your
body.  What are you going to do?  Calm down.  You've been training for this
your whole life.  You are an Xemacs wizard.  A few brief keystrokes
and you can repair the entire source in just seconds.
</p>

<p>
First you note that you cannot use the mouse.  You're ssh'd into a
remote machine through the console.  It's going to have to be done
using only command keys.  You quickly scan your eyes over the buffer
and observe the damage.  Then you lay out a plan of attack to maneuver
the buffer and fix the text.  Your cursor is located at the red
brace.  The highlighted text needs to be repaired.  (Also, note the
missing text in main, which, unfortunately, does not appear
highlighted in my browser.)
</p>


<pre>
#include &lt;stdio<span class="highlight">,</span>h&gt;

char *helloworld(void);

int main(void)
<span class="red">{</span>
    puts(helloworld())<span class="highlight">

</span>
char *helloworld(<span class="highlight">b</span>oid)
{
    return "hello world";
}

<span class="highlight">/*
  Print 'hello world' to stdout.
 */</span>
</pre>

<p>
The following sequence of keystrokes will get you from the opening
brace to just beyond the only statement in main.  It takes only a
handful of keys to get there, repair the semicolon, return statement,
and right brace.
</p>


<table>
<tr><td>C-n</td><td>next line</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-e</td><td>end of line</td></tr>
<tr><td>;</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>C-j</td><td>new line and indent</td></tr>
<tr><td>return 0;</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;RET&gt;</td><td>new line</td></tr>
<tr><td>}</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio<span class="highlight">,</span>h&gt;

char *helloworld(void);

int main(void)
{
    puts(helloworld());
    return 0;
}


char *helloworld(<span class="highlight">b</span>oid)
{
    return "hello world";
}

<span class="highlight">/*
  Print 'hello world' to stdout.
 */
</span>
</pre>

<p>
Next, you need to change boid to void.  You have no idea what the
programmer who typed boid was thinking, but it doesn't matter.  It
takes only three keys to get there and three more to correct the
problem.
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>C-s b</td><td>search for b</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-&lt;BS&gt;</td><td>delete word backwords</td></tr>
<tr><td>v</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio<span class="highlight">,</span>h&gt;

char *helloworld(void);

int main(void)
{
    puts(helloworld());
    return 0;
}


char *helloworld(void)
{
    return "hello world";
}

<span class="highlight">/*
  Print 'hello world' to stdout.
 */
</span>
</pre>

<p>
The comment at the end needs to be moved to the top.  For now, you
just need to move the text to the kill ring.  You can get there in
three strokes.  Mark the start of the text.  Move to the end in two
strokes.  And cut with just two more strokes.  It's just two remaining
strokes to return to the start of the buffer.
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>C-4 C-n</td><td>move down 4 lines</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-&lt;SPC&gt;</td><td>set mark</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-}</td><td>move to end of paragrah</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-w</td><td>cut text from mark to point</td></tr>
<tr><td>M-&lt;</td><td>goto start of buffer</td></tr>
</table>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio<span class="highlight">,</span>h&gt;

char *helloworld(void);

int main(void)
{
    puts(helloworld());
    return 0;
}


char *helloworld(void)
{
    return "hello world";
}

/*
  Print 'hello world' to stdout.
 */
</pre>

<p>
They're entering the room, but you're nearly done.  Move to the end of
the line.  Backup to the semicolon which should be a period.  Just
delete the last few characters; it will only take a fraction of a
second to retype them.  Finally, move to the next line and yank the
text back from the kill ring.  You're done.  But there's still a half
second before the client meets you.  So you kill a few lines to remove
superfluous whitespace.
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>C-e</td><td>end of line</td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;BS&gt;&lt;BS&gt;&lt;BS&gt;</td><td>backspace three
characters</td></tr>
<tr><td>.h&gt;</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>&lt;RET&gt;</td><td>new line</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-y</td><td>yank text</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-n</td><td>next line</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-k</td><td>kill line</td></tr>
<tr><td>C-k</td><td>kill line</td></tr>
</table>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
/*
  Print 'hello world' to stdout.
 */

char *helloworld(void);

int main(void)
{
    puts(helloworld());
    return 0;
}


char *helloworld(void)
{
    return "hello world";
}
</pre>

<p>
Recompile.  Success!  You will not be a frog today.  I frequently use
the arrow keys instead of C-p, C-n, C-b, C-f to move around in the
buffer.  Our hero went the other route, but using arrow keys is OK if
they're supported.  I also compile in a terminal window instead of
Xemacs.  You can do this quickly by typing Alt-Tab and then the up
key, followed by &lt;RET&gt;, assuming you just ran a compile.
