<p>
Something that tends to sicken me is the lack of code reuse.  I don't
mean simple lack of reuse, like forgetting about the substring search
in your library, and consequently re-implementing it.  What I mean is
that I see the same common code libraries and RFCs implemented over and
over again in every language out there.  When a new language is
invented, just about all the useful code out there gets re-implemented
in that language.  If a new RFC is written, a library is developed for
every useful language.
</p>

<p>
Now, there is an argument for purity, and I can somewhat respect that.
But consider the advantages of having a single implementation in one
language that can be linked to from all other languages.  I will
assume that language is C since most languages have support for linking
in C code.  Code would need to be implemented only one time, not a
hundred times for every obscure language out there.  The code would
always work the same in every language because it is, in fact, the
same code.  Bugs only need to be fixed one time.  New features are
only added once.  The code gets lots of exposure to users.  If it's
implemented in C, it will be about as fast as you can make it.
</p>

<p>
I can think of three possible negatives.  You lose the purity and the
learning experience that comes with implementing a module in the
target language.  A buggy module written in C could crash a high level
language such as Ruby.  In some cases, the code may actually run
slower if the data structure translation is slow.  However,  I think
the positives greatly outweigh the negatives in most cases.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of language independent technologies out there.  I
have very little familiarity with them.  But what I'm imagining is
something light and quick.  This does not require a new language or
lots of XML parsing and marshalling.  The functionality would be
limited but still very powerful.  Essentially, I am thinking of a
language independent shared object file.
</p>

<p>
Usually, you would link to a shared object file either at load time or
at runtime from C.  Since many languages let you link to C, you can
often make the C code that you link to, itself link to a shared object
(as I have done).  It would be nice to remove even this step, and link
directly to a shared object file.  I can think of two ways to do this.
</p>

<p>
There needs to be some method of converting native data types of the
calling language to a standard set of data types in C.  These would
need to be defined ahead of time.  It may be sufficient to limit
ourselves to a handful of the most common ones (hash table, lists,
arrays, strings, primitives, ...).  There may even be a way to allow
for specialized data types for code that really requires it, but I won't
consider that further.  There will be an extra layer between the
calling language and the code in the shared object.  The extra layer
will convert the data types.  Where this layer occurs isn't important
for the discussion.

</pre>

<p>
Notice that there is also a convert layer after the code executes.
This is because functions sometimes mutate parameters.  If the
parameters are constant for the duration of the function, this step
can be skipped.
</p>

<p>
The second way this could be implemented is to perform actions
directly on the native data structures of each language.  In the first
case, conversion functions must be written for each language.  In this
case, accessor/mutator functions must be written for each language.
The only requirement is that they all have the same interface.  Each
method has its own advantages.  The first method might be better
(speed wise) if the data is small and accessed frequently.  The second
method would be better if the data is large and accessed infrequently.
</p>

<p>
There are issues I've completely ignored, for example how to handle
things like thread safety, call backs, and more generally, invoking
code from the calling language in the shared object file.  However, I believe there are probably
decent solutions to all these problems.  And even if there aren't solutions, the
vast majority of code out there does not have these issues.
</p>

<p>
I would love to be able to write some code and then publish the API in
every language I work in and have it immediately available with no
further work.
