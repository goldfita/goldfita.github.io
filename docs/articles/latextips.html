<p>
So you've finally completed your research and are ready to write your
thesis.  And you want to use latex.  Latex is great for doing any kind
of equation editing.  It will also automatically generate figure
numbers, table of contents and figures, and do a lot of formating for
you.  But if you need to do anything more advanced than the basics,
it's not going to be anywhere near as easy as, say, the WYSIWYG of
Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>
My school had a number of standard formating requirements that were
not the same as the latex defaults.  Trying to figure out how to
change the formating rules requires some in depth knowledge of latex
(and  a lot of Googling).  I'll share with you what I learned to get
my thesis formated right.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <span class="bold">\linespread{2}</span> to double space your thesis.  You can also use
non-integer spacing.<br /><br /></li>

<li>You can redefine almost anything you want, but use a special
purpose package if you need to do something difficult or non-obvious.
I used the following packages.<br /><br />

<ul>
<li>fancyhdr - Use this to change things like page numbering, headers,
and footers.<br /><br /></li>

<li>graphicx - You'll need this for importing graphics.  I always used
.eps for postscript and .pdf (use ps2pdf) for pdf extensions.  You can
have latex decide which extension is appropriate by not giving it the
extension.  It will figure out whether to use the .pdf or .eps.  As an
example, use<br /><br />
<span class="bold">\includegraphics[totalheight=0.6 \textheight,width=1\textwidth]{texfigs/misalign}</span>
<br /><br />
The directory of my images is texfigs.  The file is
misalign[.pdf][.eps].<br /><br /></li>

<li>maple2e - You can use this package if you want to import maple
code.<br /><br /></li>

<li>subfig - I used this for figures broken across many pages.  All
you have to do is put <span class="bold">/ContinuedFloat</span> inside the next figure and latex
will number it the same as the last one.  You can also use this package
to control multiple images or figures inside a single figure.  I
didn't know about this and did it the hard way by redefining
<span class="bold">fnum@figure</span>.  If you want to go that route, use<br /><br />
<span class="bold">\makeatletter \renewcommand{\fnum@figure}{Figure \thefigure
\hspace{1em}(cont.)} \makeatother</span>
<br /><br />
before the figure to redefine the caption.  The <span class="bold">\thefigure</span> command is
the figure number.  Make sure to change it back after the figure
unless you want to keep it that way.<br /><br /></li>

<li>caption - You can use<br /><br />
<span class="bold">
\usepackage[justification=raggedright,
singlelinecheck=false]{caption}</span><br /><br />

to left justify all your captions<br /><br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Change the page numbering style using <span class="bold">\pagenumbering{roman}</span> or
<span class="bold">\pagenumbering{arabic}</span>.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Get a new page with <span class="bold">/newpage</span>.  You might need this if you need a
special page before the first chapter that isn't a standard page (like
the table of contents).  Use <span class="bold">/clearpage</span> to end the current page.  This
will force latex to flush all it's images.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Change page dimensions with <br />
<pre>
<span class="bold">\addtolength{\oddsidemargin}{-.3in}
\addtolength{\evensidemargin}{-.3in}
\addtolength{\textwidth}{.7in}</span>
</pre>
<br />
Change float spacing with <br />
<pre><span class="bold">\renewcommand\floatpagefraction{.9}
\renewcommand\topfraction{.9}
\renewcommand\bottomfraction{.9}
\renewcommand\textfraction{.1}   
\setcounter{totalnumber}{50}
\setcounter{topnumber}{50}
\setcounter{bottomnumber}{50}</span>
</pre>
<br /><br /></li>

<li>If you don't want the really fancy contents title that latex uses,
you can do <br /><br />

<span class="bold">\renewcommand{\contentsname}{\hspace{1.8in} \large
CONTENTS}</span>.<br /><br /></li>

<li>If you need to remove a dangling line and increase or decrease a
page size one line, use <span class="bold">\enlargethispage{+\baselineskip}</span>.  Change the
'+' to '-' to shrink the page.  Make sure to place it between two
paragraphs.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Use <span class="bold">/def</span> to define symbols and text you use often.  This will be
especially helpful for equation editing.<br /><br /></li>


<li>Use <span class="bold">/label</span> directly after captions in figures.  Make sure the
caption is outside of any inner environments in the figure
environment.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Use <span class="bold">//</span> to force a new line.  I often use this in eqnarray.  Use
<span class="bold">/nonumber</span> to skip numbering the equation.  You can skip equation
numbering for the entire environment by putting a star after the
environment name.  E.g. <span class="bold">/begin{eqnarray*}</span>.<br /><br /></li>

<li>You can add lines to the table of contents using
<span class="bold">\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{References}</span>.  Place this right before
the bibliography and you'll get References added to the TOC.<br /><br /></li>

<li>If you need to enter non-bibitems in the bibliography, one
solution is to use an empty bibitem.  For example, <br /><br />
<span class="bold">\makeatletter\def\@biblabel#1{\bf{General References}}\makeatother 
\bibitem[ ]{}</span>
<br /><br />
</li>


<li>To shorten captions in the list of figures, use <span class="bold">/caption[Short
version]{Loooooong version}</span>.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Sometimes importing certain images will change the amount of
whitespace around the image.  To fix this, use the viewport option
inside include - <span class="bold">,viewport=75 180 550 600,clip</span>.  That's left of
image, bottom of image, right of image, and top of image respectively.<br /></li>
</ul>
