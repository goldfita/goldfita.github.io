<h1 class="topofpage">To Catch a Kernel Crash</h1>
<p>
It took me several weeks from the time I assembled my computer from parts, to the point at which I had a
fully operational machine with internet connection.  A large part of the problem was that the machine was
locking up badly multiple times a day.  I eventually found and corrected two problems.  The first was a
bug in the scsi raid module, aic7xxx.  I had to upgrade to kernel 2.6.16-rc2 from 2.6.15.1 to fix the 
problem.  The second problem was ndiswrapper (or the driver I installed with it).  I eventually replaced
the ethernet hardware, and all my problems went away.
</p>

<h3>Getting Debug Output</h3>
<p>
The nasty thing about a driver that controls your hard disk is that it
can really mess-up your disks.  After 
my machine would go down, I could often hear the raid drives being rebuilt for 5 or 10 minutes after reboot.  
A few times I had to start from the livecd and manually tell the drives to rebuild. 
</p>

<p>
So, how did I diagnose the problem?  The first thing I did was compile some debug modules into the kernel.  
The modules I have are:
</p>
<pre>
--&gt; Kernel Hacking
    --&gt; Kernel Debugging
    --&gt; Detect Soft Lockups
    --&gt; Mutex Debugging Deadlock Detection
    --&gt; Check for Stack Overflows
</pre>
<p>
Also, enable logging.  Log files are written to /var/log/xxx where xxx may be any log file or directory 
of log files.  My logger was not enabled by default.  Make sure you configure it to print kernel output.  And 
add it to the default runlevel.  In Gentoo you can do this with <span
class="bold">rc-update</span>.  Turn up kernel output as high as you can with <span class="bold">dmesg -n8</span>.
You will need to do this again after reboot.  I didn't know about this at the time.  But I suggest you 
experiment.  Try just typing <span class="bold">dmesg</span>.
</p>

<p>
I was lucky enough to get some output before the machine locked up for good.  Unfortunately, I had no way of 
saving the output -- it was just dumped to the console.  And furthermore, much of it scrolled off the screen.  
I ended up taking some low quality pictures of the screen.  This was enough.  I posted a bug to <a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/">
bugzilla.kernel.org</a>.  I was told to try kernel 2.6.16-rc2.  So far this has been working for me.  Unfortunately, 
one of the irritating things about having a release kernel is that you can no longer compile some drivers.  For example, I need 
the fglrx module for my video card.  (I'm not sure if this is compiled or in binary form.)  It won't work with the kernel I have now.
But having a working raid disk is more important to me.
</p>

<p>
I later learned how to capture the output that's dumped to the console.  It has come in handy for a few 
different problems.  You will need a second computer, a null modem cable (just a few dollars), and serial 
port access.  Add serial support for console output over the serial port:
</p>
<pre>
--&gt; Device Drivers
    --&gt; Character Devices
        --&gt; Serial Drivers
            --&gt; Console on 8250/16550
                and Compatible Serial Port
</pre>
<p>
Add the correct tty parameters to your boot configuration.  My grub configuration looks like
<span class="bold">kernel /boot/kernel-2.6.15.1 root=/dev/md2 hda=scsi nmi_watchdog=2 console=ttyS0,57600 
console=tty0</span>.  I'll talk about nmi_watchdog later.  The first console parameter says to output at 
57600 bps over the serial port, ttyS0.  The other one (tty0), says to output to the standard console.  (You can also 
view tty1 through tty5 by typing <span class="bold">Ctrl+Alt+Fx</span> where x can be 1 - 6.  These are known as 
virtual consoles.)  After you reboot, you should be able to type <span class="bold">echo hi &gt; /dev/ttyS0</span> 
and see the output on the other computer.  In order to read the data over the cable, make sure the cable is connected to 
both serial ports.  I'm using hyperterminal in windows on the other machine.  Run it, select com1, and make sure to set 
the bit rate to 57600 (or whatever you used).  You should see 'hi'.  The connection should continue to work 
even after you reboot the linux machine.  Now, any kernel output should be displayed both on your screen and in 
hyperterminal.
</p>

<h3>LKCD</h3>
<p>
I decided I needed to be more aggressive in my debugging attempts.  So, I installed the Linux Kernel Core Dump 
utility.  I wrote my own live <a href="../freesoft/opensource.html">ebuild</a> for this since there was no way to emerge.  
By the time you read this, a stable 8.0 version may be out.  But I had to use the 7.x.x development version.  It ended
up working ok, but it took a lot of effort to set it up.
</p>

<p>
You need a custom patch for your kernel that you may have to download separately from sourceforge.  Because I had 
an rc kernel, someone made me a custom patch.  After applying the patch, you need to compile the lkcd modules.  I 
used modules because compiling into the kernel wouldn't work for some reason.  Also compile in watchdog timer support.
</p>
<pre>
--&gt; Kernel Hacking
    --&gt; LKCD Crash Dump Support
    --&gt; LKCD Crash DUMP Device Driver
    --&gt; LKCD Crash Dump Gzip Compression

--&gt; Device Drivers
    --&gt; Character Devices
        --&gt; Watchdog Cards
            --&gt; Watchdog Timer Support
</pre>
<p>
And you will need to add the nmi_watchdog parameter to the boot line
as mentioned before.  Try assigning the value 1 first.  
Then check the NMI line in /proc/interrupts.  If it's zero, try setting nmi_watchdog=2.  If it's still zero, you may not
have NMI watchdog timer support.  If you used modules, make sure to include the modules dump_gzip, dump_blockdev, dump, 
zlib_inflate, zlib_deflate in your autoload modules file (/etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6 on my machine).
</p>

<p>
Next you need to configure dumputils.  Just use my /etc/<a href="http://www.signalsguru.net/articles/builtpc/dumputils.conf">dumputils.conf</a> unless you want to do something 
fancy.  Create a link from /dev/vmdump to your swap partition (<span class="bold">ln -s /dev/sda2 /dev/vmdump</span>).  
You can now configure and start lkcd -- <span class="bold">/etc/init.d/dumputils start</span>.  Then check that /sys/dump/polling is 1.  If it's 0,
you don't have polling, which is bad.  The dumputils script 
needs to be run at startup.  Unfortunately, you can't just add it to the startup scripts.  It has to be run before swapon so that the dump
can be copied from the swap to /var/log/dump/x (x will be between 0 and 9).  Alternatively, you could have lkcd dump to a reserved 
partition if you have one free.  Because my swapon is in the localmount startup script which is in the boot runlevel, I tried
to add my script before localmount.  I had two problems.  The first is that the script was apparently not written in a way such that it could 
be used as a start script (in Gentoo).  It was basically just a bash script with a case statement.  I changed it so that it used the standard 
start/stop functions.  I also added a dependency.
</p>
<pre class="code">
depend() {
	before localmount
}
</pre>
<p>
This is supposed to ensure that if you add the script to the same runlevel as mount, it will run before mount.  But 
for some reason it just wouldn't work.  The localmount script really wanted to run first.  But at least the script was running
at startup now.  I finally just copied the relevant code over to my localmount script.  Insert the following before 
swapon.
</p>
<pre class="code">
CONFIGDUMP=/usr/sbin/configdump
SAVEDUMP=/usr/sbin/savedump
${CONFIGDUMP}
${SAVEDUMP}
</pre>
<p>
Now it was working.  In order to test it, check out buncho in the lkcd 
<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/lkcd/lkcd/buncho/">directory</a>.  After you build and install, type 
<span class="bold">./do_insmod</span> to insert the modules.  Then type <span class="bold">dmesg -n8 &amp;&amp; ./bunchotest hello</span>.
It should run the hello test.  Next try read_oops.  (I suggest you backup first.)  If lkcd is setup properly, it will dump a kernel
image to your swap partition and reboot.  On reboot, it will copy the dump from swap to /var/log/dump/0/dump.0.  If lkcd was not
working properly, the kernel will probably complain, but it shouldn't crash.  There are several other tests you can do with bunchotest.  
All of them will attempt to crash or lockup your kernel (except for hello).
</p>

<p>
That's the hardest part.  You have successfully acquired a dump.  Now you can analyze it by going to the dump directory and running 
lcrash -n x, where x is the number of the directory.  First you should make sure you have the files dump.x (the kernel dump), map.x, 
and kerntypes.x.  Run a diff on map.x and /usr/src/linux/System.map.  Also run a diff on kerntypes.x and /usr/src/linux/init/kerntypes.o.  
If either is different, copy the one from the linux directory.  Otherwise, lcrash won't start.  You can type <span class="bold">?</span> for help.
Also try <span class="bold">report</span> and <span class="bold">trace</span> for some immediate feedback on what crashed your kernel.
</p>

<p>
This took me a a long time to get set up correctly.  However, I could probably do it in about 10 minutes now.  Unfortunately, it could not catch 
the bug that was crashing my kernel*.  I didn't get a dump at all.  But I did find out that it was ndiswrapper that was causing the problems.  When I 
bought the null modem cable, I also got a cheap ethernet card (on suspicion).  When I replaced the wireless usb device, the crashes stopped.  Whatever the 
problem was, it must have been really nasty.  It is still unfortunate that I could not generate a dump of the problem however.
</p>

<h3>Patching a Kernel</h3>
<p>
I had to patch and reverse patch the kernel many times.  It's second nature now.  My first kernel was 2.6.12-gentoo-r6.  I moved to
2.6.15.1 so I could install a device driver (which turned out to be the wrong one).  I later had to patch to 2.6.16-rc2 because of 
the bug in aic7xxx.  There were numerous other patches, such as one that allows the kernel to have 16k stacks, one for lkcd, and one 
for the firewire drive I bought (which still doesn't work).  There are a few things you need to know when patching.  You always have to patch
from the previous version.  So,
</p>
<pre>
patch -p1 &lt; patch-2.6.15
</pre>
<p>
will get you from kernel 2.6.14 to 2.6.15.  To get to 2.6.16-rc2 (release candidate two), apply the patch to 2.6.15 (not 16).  If you needed to
go from 2.6.15-rc1 to 2.6.15-rc2, look in the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/incr/">testing/incremental</a> directory for patch-2.6.16-rc1-rc2.  There are also incremental 
kernel patches for stable release kernels.  Sometimes you will need to reverse patch.  For example, I needed to move from 2.6.15.1 to 2.6.15 so I 
could patch to 2.6.16-rc2.  Use the <span class="bold">-R</span> option.  Here is an example of some of the patching/reverse patching I had to do.  (I'm 
in 2.6.16-rc3 now.)
</p>
<pre>
    2.6.15.1
       --&gt; 16k patch
       &lt;-- remove 16k patch (A)
&lt;-- reverse 2.6.15.1 patch
--&gt;patch 16k
    --&gt; 2.6.16-rc2 patch
        --&gt; 2.6.16-rc2-git6 patch (B)
            --&gt; lkcd patch
            &lt;-- reverse lkcd patch
        &lt;-- reverse 2.6.16-rc2-git6 patch
        --&gt; lkcd patch
            --&gt; 2.6.16-rc2-rc3 patch
</pre>

<p>
(A) I'm not sure if it's necessary to reverse the 16k patch since I'm going to apply it again anyway.  But I did it just to be sure 
the following patches succeeded.  (B) I can't remember now if the git patch is applied to the rc2 kernel or another version.  The 
git kernel is the latest kernel in the git repo.  I'm not even sure if it's guarantee to compile.  It turned out I didn't even need it.  
</p>

<p>
<span class="bold">*</span>
I've updated to ndiswrapper 1.10, which is supposed to be stable with smp.  So far it appears to be stable (at least with 
debug output disabled).
</p>

<hr />
<h4 class="nounderline">Update</h4>

<p>
In the past month or so I've had very little problem, but my machine
has crashed a few times.  It crashed twice one day.  This time LKCD
was able to catch the crash.  I <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=813">posted</a> about it, but there was no
interest.  Since I'm the type of person who doesn't like to throw
things away, especially useful information, I've decided to post it
here in case it ever comes in handy.  It will also give you a preview
of a real life crash report.  I have named the links the same as the lcrash
command that generated the output.
