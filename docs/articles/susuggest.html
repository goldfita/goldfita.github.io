<h1 class="topofpage">Suggestions for New Companies</h1>

<p>
I've worked for a couple of startups now, and I have a few brief things
I want to say about what they shouldn't do.  I've been bitten by these
things at least once.  And really, in the end, everyone loses --
employees, customers, and entrepreneurs.

<h4 class="nounderline">Requirements Analysis</h4>
<p>
Doing all the requirements analysis upfront obviously isn't going to be
very effective for large (interesting) projects.  It helps to spend
some time thinking about them and to get something down on paper.  But
ultimately, without building some type of prototype and letting people
try the product, you just can't know exactly what you need.
</p><p>
Well that's no big deal.  But it's the ever changing requirements
startups incur that is reallly frustrating.  I've had requirements change on
me repeatedly.  OK, you say, that doesn't sound too horrible.  But
I've had them change back and forth!  I've been told, we need it to do
x, then later it's y, and then later it's x again.  This is just a
horrible use of time.  And it certainly doesn't make me feel good
having to do the same thing over and over again.
</p><p>
There are some things you can do.  It's worth a considerable amount of
time really trying to figure out what the customers want.  I've heard
that microsoft makes a paper prototype of their GUIs before they code
them.  Then they show potential customers the interface and get
feedback.
</p><p>
If you really can't get decent input from the customer and you have no
idea how the interface should work and what features it should have,
you can quickly build a prototype and let them try it for free.
Another thing you can do is refuse to make any changes in a given
amount of time.  That way you can queue up requests for changes.  And
hopefully in that time, x will "change" to y and back to x without any
actual work being done (only in people's heads).
</p><p>
Customers may not know what they want.  They'll insist on having such
and such a feature and then no one will ever use it.  And managers
won't know either.  They'll insist on the features they think people
will use, and then no one will find a use for them.  People are
unpredictable.  Even they don't know what they want.  Sometimes it's
better to just let the engineers design what excites them.  If the
customers don't know, and the managers don't know, then certainly this
is not going to hurt.  And by giving the engineers freedom, motivation
will go up, and you will get a higher quality product in far less
time.  Think about how math becomes applied.  A genius pursing his own
interests invents some elegant but utterly useless math.  A hundred
years later, someone else figures out how to make it do something we
care about.  In this same sense, by providing freedom, you may get
something useful (and hopefully on a shorter time scale) even though
it was not obvious at the time.

<h4 class="nounderline">Technological Maturity</h4>

<p>
There are different types of problems.  There are easy problems, hard
problems, problems with a single obvious solution, problems with many
solutions, good problems, and bad problems.  Trying to solve a problem
with the wrong technology is a bad problem.  In fact, it's a pseudo
problem.  The real problem is either finding the right technology, or
inventing it yourself if it doesn't exist.
</p><p>
If the technology doesn't do quite what you want, then it's either
immature or you're using the wrong technology.  If the right
technology doesn't exist, then this is the extreme form of immature
technology.  In either case, you don't want to use it.  When you first
start out trying to force it to work for you, everything will seem
OK.  You'll find clever solutions to get around the little problems.
But they'll just come back and bite you later.  More and more little
problems will creep in.  You may find the project is getting messier
and harder to manage and difficult to understand (and this can happen
regardless).  It's very likely you'll run up against a problem that
has no clever solution.
</p><p>
Resist.  Resist the urge.  Resist any pressure.  If it's not feasible
to create the technology to solve your problem, you might be better
off letting go.  Move on to something that you can do.  Trying to make
something do what it doesn't want to do will not have good results.
