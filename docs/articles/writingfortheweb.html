<p>
I have been writing opinions and short howtos for my web site for a
while now.  By carefully researching successful technical documents
on the web, I have managed to come up with a basic understanding of
which documents will be most useful.
</p><p>
First, there is the issue of presentation.  You don't need to have a
super snazzy web site (although it helps) with lots of graphics.  But you should make sure
you have legible fonts and no painful colors.  Keep paragraphs short.
Long ones are especially hard to read on the web.  Break your articles
into sections with horizontal rules and section headers.  If it's a
really long article, use multiple pages and a contents section.
</p><p>
I have frequently had the experience of coming up with what I thought
was a great idea for an article, only to end up disappointed.  I start
out thinking it's going to be ten pages, insightful, and full of
information.  It ends up being one page, jumping between topics that
are barely relevant, and short on useful material.  Well things  don't
always work the same in the real world as they do in your head.
</p><p>
There are a few things you can do.  Unless you're an incredible
writer with lots of insight, you might want to stick to mostly tutorials instead of
opinions.  I haven't done that so far, but I have noticed that the
instructive articles are the most searched for.
</p><p>
Focused is better
than a sampler.  In other words, very specific articles are usually
more useful than brief overviews of general areas.  A number of people
have found my <a href="latextips.html">latex tips</a> page from
google.  Usually they're looking for figure help.  Notice, there's
only a few short sentences about figures.  Compare that with <a
href="latexfig/latexfig.html">latex figures</a>.  I expanded that information
out into much more.  If I really knew latex figure in depth, I
probably could have written ten pages.  That might be an article worth
linking to.
</p><p>
A picture is worth a thousand words.  If you're trying to describe
something technical, it might be worth even more.  Again, go back and
compare the last two articles.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a
picture; any type of diagram can be helpful.  Taking the time to make
an image, diagram, or table can be time consuming, but it can also make
all the difference in the world.
</p><p>
Most of the best content out there wasn't written in one sitting.  It
evolved over time with editing and feed back from readers.  The author
may not have even known much of the content when he started.  Often
you just don't think of useful information until weeks or months
later.  If you're planning on becoming an expert on some technology,
you can start writing about it, and add to it as you learn more.
</p><p>
Sometimes it helps to present something in multiple different ways.
For example, this <a href="http://mythic-beasts.com/support/topic_fastcgi.html">page</a> shows you how to write a basic
Fast CGI script in multiple languages.  This will also be helpful to
readers viewing this page who may only know one of those languages.
In some cases, you might also do this for a comparison.
</p><p>
Make source code part of the article.  It's OK to have the file as a
link.  But if you break it into pieces (and format and color it), and
cover a chunk at a time, it's a lot easier to understand.  Compare
this to six pages of text describing a few pages of code that you
happened to link to in your resources section.
</p><p>
Give examples and make comparisons.  This will lengthen the article
and help clarify the original explanation.  Make lists and use bold
type where appropriate.  This will highlight important material.  Add humor if you can.
Let's face it, technical material tends to be pretty dull.  You don't
want your audience falling asleep on page one of "An inside look at
the design and implementation of the XYZ compiler."
