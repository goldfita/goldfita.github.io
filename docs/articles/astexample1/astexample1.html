<h1 class="topofpage">Combining Tele-communications and E-commerce (Asterisk, Java, and Python
- Oh My!)</h1>

<p>This very gentle introduction to development with <a href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a> will demonstrate
how to use the AGI. Along the way you'll learn about Python and Java as well. I'll
assume you're able to set up and configure Asterisk.</p>

<p>The Asterisk Gateway Interface (AGI) allows an application you write (in
whatever language you choose) to communicate directly with Asterisk using
simple descriptive text commands. Normally you place your application in
/var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin and Asterisk will execute it when it is encountered
in the dial plan. Most of the commands are explained <a
href="http://home.cogeco.ca/~camstuff/agi.html">here</a>. They are fairly
straight forward, so I'll only demonstrate a few. There are three other AGIs
you should be aware of. There is the dead AGI which allows you to run an
application after a call ends. There is the fast AGI which lets your
application communicate with Asterisk over TCP. And there is the extended AGI
which is supposed to let your application view the audio stream on file
descriptor three. But I don't know the state of this last AGI.</p>

<p>Now here is your task. M&amp;M wants to add a new color to their current
selection. The choices are pink, emerald green, and mahogany. You will be
responsible for developing the phone based voting system that will allow
customers to vote for these new delicious sounding candies. In addition, you
will need to make the results available to the public on a website in a
graphical format.</p>

<p>First take a look at the code below. You can find agi.py in the resources
section (along with a link to the explanation). You'll also want the <a
href="connect.py">connection</a> code. </p>

<p>This is our interface to asterisk. Every time a caller dials in, this script
will be run. The first line of the try block executes the STREAM FILE command.
The first argument is the name of the file to play, and the second argument are
the keys the caller can press. In this example, the caller can press one, two,
or three for the three colors. The next line connects to the database. The
number is mapped to a color and the corresponding row is selected from the
database. The number of votes is incremented and put back. That's all.</p>

<p>Now let's take a look at the code for generating a plot of the results. In
order to do this, we'll use Jython for its graphics libraries. I won't go much
into the graphics libraries, but you can have a look at the references below.</p>

<p>First we go into a loop that executes every 60 seconds (making this
effectively an image server). Then we select the total votes for each of the
colors from the database. Last the image generation routine is called with the
votes. The numbers are normalized. A new image is created, and the background
is set to white. Each of the three colors is painted on the background as a
vertical bar with the height corresponding to the number of votes. Some
identifying text is placed beneath each bar. Then the <a href="votes.jpeg">image</a>
is written out as a jpeg.</p>

<p>The last bit of code is for handling database connections in Python and
Jython and is not discussed here. If you have a decent understanding of Python,
you should be able to follow the code.</p>

<p>
<span class="bold">Exercises (Warning - I haven't tried these.)</span><br />
1) Add two more colors to the choices.<br />
2a) Try rewriting the plot generation routine to make a pie chart.<br />
2b) Change it to an animated gif and modify it to show changes over time.<br />
2c) Put a web page around it and make it accessible from the internet.<br />
3) Modify all the code to use Jython (for consistency and simplicity). Separate
the image server from the rest of the code by using Java's RMI. </p>
