<h1 class="topofpage">Asterisk Applications</h1>

<p>
In order to build an Asterisk Application, you'll need to create a new
c source file and build a shared object file from it.  The easiest way to do this is
to simply add your application to the makefile in the apps directory.
Asterisk loads each application at runtime and executes it in a
separate thread for each incoming call.
</p>
<p>
For this example, I've modified the echo application.  Echo just takes
the incoming signal and immediately sends it back to the phone
speaker.  This lets you hear the delay.  My modification will dial
another phone on extension 1002 and echo the input from the first
phone, merged with a speech file on disk, to the second phone.  My
intention was to include Automatic Gain Control, but due to lack of
resources, I wasn't able to include this.  So, I'll leave this as an
exercise for you.*
</p>
<p>
I'll go over the <a href="test_echo.c">code</a> from the top.  The
static variables at the top are used by Asterisk help to explain the
function of the application.  The app variable is the name of the
application that will go in the extensions.conf file.  The following two
macros are needed for usecount management in dynamically loaded
modules.
<br /><br />
STANDARD_LOCAL_USER;<br />
LOCAL_USER_DECL;
<br /><br />
You will need to place LOCAL_USER_ADD(u) and LOCAL_USER_REMOVE(u)
at the beginning and end of your main routine respectively.  This
will prevent Asterisk from trying to do anything funny, like unload a
module while someone is in a call.
</p>
<p>
Our main function is named echo_exec.  The first parameter is always a
channel structure (which holds information about our call).  The next
parameter is a void pointer.  This will be filled with data from the
extensions.conf file.  This application doesn't use it (so I override
data in a local variable for my own use).  
</p>

<table>
<tr><td>Now take a look at the following variable declarations:</td></tr>
<tr><td><pre class="code">
struct localuser *u;
struct ast_frame *f=NULL,*pframe,*trframe=NULL;
struct ast_filestream *play;
struct ast_trans_pvt *trans;
struct ast_channel *chan2;
static struct ast_frame null_frame = 
{
   AST_FRAME_NULL,
};
</pre></td></tr></table>

<p>
The first structure, localuser, is needed by the macros just
mentioned.  Next I create three frames.  A frame holds a small chunk
of signal data and information about that chunk.  f is the frame
read from the original caller.  The file is read into pframe.  trframe is a translation of pframe into raw
PCM format.  Next, play, is a pointer to the file to be played from disk.  trans
is a codec translator.  chan2 is the channel of the phone that will be
dialed.  The null_frame is used to assign a "zero" frame to trframe
when ast_translate returns a null pointer.
</p>

<p>
Next, add a user, and open the file "yourprompt", which you need to
replace with a valid file name.  Request a new channel in PCM for extension
1002.  If this is successful, force it to read and write in PCM.  This
means any data read from chan2 will appear as PCM to the test_echo
application regardless of the actual codec used by the phone.  Any
data that is written should be in PCM.  Asterisk will make sure it is
delivered in the appropriate format.
</p>
<p>
This is where things get a bit tricky.  The commands
ast_openstream and ast_readframe will try to read in the file and
convert straight to the outgoing codec.  But the data needs to be in
PCM.  So a translator must be allocated to convert from the outgoing
codec into PCM.  This is a bit inefficient because now the file read
from disk is being converted from the codec on disk to the outgoing
codec and then into PCM (and then back to the outgoing codec when we
finish with it).  Unfortunately I couldn't find a better way to do
this, but it works.  Next the original channel is set to read and
write in PCM.  There's no funny business here - ast_read will convert
the data into PCM as requested.
</p>
<p>
Next, go into a loop that quits on hang-up or some error.  Read a frame
of input from the caller at the beginning of the loop.  Then read a
frame from a file on disk.  Quit when the entire file has been
played.  Now, take the translated frame from the last iteration and
combine it with the incoming call stream.  Set the delivery seconds and
microseconds to zero, so the frame will be delivered immediately.
Write the combined frame to both channels.  Translate the frame from
disk so that it can be used on the next iteration.  Remember to free
frames and translators and call LOCAL_USER_REMOVE before quitting.
</p>
<p>
The remaining functions are for loading/unloading modules, returning a
description of the application, returning the usecount, and returning
the a key which Asterisk needs to run the application.  The key
basically states the application has a GNU General Public License.
</p>

<p>
<span class="bold">Exercises (warning - I haven't tried these)</span><br />
1) Allow the caller to enter the number to which he wants to connect.<br />
2) Change the loop so it doesn't end when the file on disk has been
played.<br />
3) Take the <a href="agc.c">AGC</a> code and make it work on the
output.<br />
</p>

<p>*I really wanted to try the PSOLA Algorithm, which is used for pitch
shifting of human speech.  But I believe there is a patent on it, and I
couldn't find a good description of the algorithm.  If you would like
to try it yourself, go right ahead.  I suggest using DTMF 1 to lower
the pitch, DTMF 2 to return to normal, and DTMF 3 to raise the pitch.
If you have matlab (or octave) I suggest trying the same technique I used
for AGC.</p>
