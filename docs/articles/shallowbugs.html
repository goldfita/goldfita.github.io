<h1 class="topofpage">Shallow Bugs</h1>

<p>
It has been said that given enough pairs of eyes, all bugs are
shallow.  What this means is that any bug can be easy to find if the
right person is looking at it.  I want to present a brief analysis of
why this might be true, but first an example.
</p>

<p>
Back when I was working with Asterisk, I needed to have a fine grain
of control over writes and reads to wav files.  It became apparent
very quickly when I started working on the features I was asked to
implement that something was wrong.  It didn't take me too terribly
long poking around inside the code and figure out what was going on.
One problem was that the flags were not being set correctly for
appending to the end of the file.  Another was that the header was not
always getting corrected before the file was closed.  The first
problem was fixed promptly (merged into the Asterisk code base).  I
don't know what happened with the second.
</p>

<p>
So why is it that a few hundred thousand people were using Asterisk,
and no one was even aware (as far as I know) of the problem?  The
thing about software, as you should know, is that it grows
exponentially complex.  Imagine a decently large program between
10,000 and 100,000 lines.  Think how many conditional branches are in
that code.  Trying to exercise every line of code, and error
conditions especially, is an incredible
task.  With programs such as Asterisk, you also have a lot of I/O and
timing issues on top of that.  But this doesn't even begin to describe
the magnitude of the problem.  To truly test your code, you must
exercise, not every line, but every path through the source.  You must
put your program in all possible states and see how it behaves.
Adding one more conditional branch to your program can double the
complexity.  This is where the exponential part comes in.
</p>

<p>
Most programs work under normal every day use.  Even without rigorous
testing, the programmer can easily verify that the code works
basically in the way intended.  It's when the code is subjected to
extreme situations, such as under heavy load, with low memory
available, and asked to do uncommon tasks that it fails.  This is
because the code can be extremely difficult to test in these corner
cases.  It might be difficult to test because there are just so many
features.  Or the state machines are just incredibly complicated.  Or
it's hard to simulate a low-memory, heavily-loaded machine.  Or
perhaps the programmer just didn't think (or didn't have time) to test
that portion of the code.
</p>

<p>
Consider my task with Asterisk.  I was using a very specific feature
in the file I/O portion of Asterisk which probably isn't used often or
at all.  There is special code for half a
dozen different file types and half a dozen different codecs in
Asterisk.  Even with so many people using Asterisk, it may have only
been me and maybe a few other people who had ever really needed this
feature to work.  In my case it was imperative that it work
correctly.  I highly focused my efforts on this feature to ensure that
it was working.  In effect, I became a unit test(er).
</p>

<p>
Under normal circumstances, the programmer does not critically examine
every bit of code.  He might test a few basic cases to convince
himself it works.  Thus, it's not until someone like me comes along
who needs that obscure feature, that the problem is discovered.  I am
doing, what ideally, it was th programmer's (or QAs) job to do.  But
if you think about it, this process of bug elimination is effective.  If
no one is using that code, how much does it matter if it's broken?
When I needed it to work, I found the problem immediately.  My focus
was that feature, not the main program.
</p>

<p>
That is why bugs are shallow.  A popular program will effectively have
an army of unit testers.  Many will use only the standard features.
But a decent number will need to utilize the more esoteric
capabilities.  It's their focus on the edge cases that makes bugs,
which seem difficult to track down for others, easy.  They are testing
exactly the feature they need, whereas someone else may only be
testing it accidentally and on rare occasions and in the wrong way, from
the wrong perspective.
