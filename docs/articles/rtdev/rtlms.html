<p>
I submitted a short article to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C/C%2B%2B_Users_Journal">C Users
Journal</a> for the March 2006 issue on developing embedded real-time
DSP algorithms.  More information is available on my <a
href="../../projects/thesis/thesis_page.html">thesis</a> page.  This
is the C <a href="echocancel.c">source</a> and matlab <a
href="testEchoCancel.m">driver</a>.  You'll also need the optimized TI

The figures below are intended as additional aid for understanding
circular buffers and filtering.  The first shows the input buffer and
full length input signal buffer.  Notice the input buffer is only 256
elements.  The DMA buffers 256 samples in this buffer and then
interrupts the CPU.  However, because the filter is 1024 elements, we
really need to store the past 1024 elements of the input.  If you're
clever, you might be able to figure out how to get the DMA to write to
different areas of a larger buffer.  But that won't do you much good
if you need to convert to float.  Instead, I've broken the larger
buffer into four segments, and then I just copy the 256 point buffer
into the current region of the larger buffer.  When I say current
region, I mean the most recent samples where the filter begins.  This
shifts each frame - section 0 (0-255), section 1 (256-511), section 2
(512-767), section 3 (768-1023), section 0 (0-255), and so on.

What makes this such a pain is that the start of the filter always has
to begin at the start of the current region, not the start of large
buffer.  But the filter still has to extend all the way back over the
past 1024 samples.  The last samples are located just before the start
of the current region.  This is demonstrated below.  The current
region is section 2 (sample 256 in this case).  That means filter
coefficient 768 is multiplied by the sample at the beginning of the
large buffer.  And coefficient 769 is multiplied by the next sample,
etc.  This, of course, means you need to calculate the index so that
it wraps correctly, or use some special circular buffering hardware.
