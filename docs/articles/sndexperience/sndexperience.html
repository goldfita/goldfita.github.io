<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
It was Wednesday afternoon -- hardly a week to go before my intended
date of graduation. The day felt like it was already over when the
boss walked in. He had that look. The one that says you're not
getting out of here yet. He proceeded to explain what would become my
final project in the remaining days before I left the state. I kept
nodding my head as I was trying to grasp the requirements. Once all
the implications of the project were finally clear, I was left with
only one thought running through my mind: "You want me to do what with
an audio editor?  Go do it yourself."  But I just kept nodding my
head.
</p><p>
After making my protestations clear, I slouched down into my chair and
started looking for an audio editor with some type of advanced
scripting features. I was almost certain that if it was out there, it
would be open source. After all, open source had made me employable.
And it had made any number of projects, not just easier, but possible.
After browsing for a while, I had found some free software and some
expensive software. But there was nothing that seemed to offer the
type of flexibility I was looking for. I was getting ready to give my
boss the bad news. And then there it was. Snd -- the Emacs of audio.
</p><p>
This had to be it. I built the package and started experimenting
immediately. Within a few hours I was writing simple extension scheme
scripts in Guile, and by the next day I was making Gtk Widgets in that
same language. It was very late when I left that night. The package
was chock-full of DSP routines. It even had a scheme-coded Fractional
FFT!  Never did I think I would see lisp and DSP together in the same
package. Well I'm not really a scheme hacker. And I didn't know a
thing about Gtk. But that didn't stop me from e-mailing my boss
screen shots of a nearly completed solution that Friday evening.

<h3>About Snd</h3>
<p>
Snd was designed using the Emacs philosophy of a built-in interpreter.
In fact, Snd works very much like Emacs.  You can go to the beginning
and end of the audio buffer by typing C-a and C-e respectively.  Use
C-f and C-b to step forward and backwards a sample.  Need to open a
file?  It's C-x f.  Kill an audio buffer?  C-x k.  There are also some
Snd specific key bindings like C-x p to play the selection.  The press
C-t to stop.  Or play from the cursor with C-q.  And of course you can
always create your own bindings.
</p><p>
When you open a new file, only the very beginning of the audio is
displayed.  You can scroll the bottom slider to view more samples.
The slider above will keep the number of samples in the window
constant but allow you to scroll through the audio.  Click on the f
box to view the spectrum.  You can also scroll through the spectrum.
If you open another file, it will display in an attached window, but
you can use the notebook option at the command line to get tabbed audio
buffers.

</p><p> The scripting ability of Snd is ultimately what enabled me to
solve my problem.  I was able to write a custom application with a
fancy graphical interface. I used Gtk, but you could also use Motif.
I found it very easy to begin writing scripts.  You simply call your
script as a command line parameter to Snd.  The only difficulty I had
was debugging.  If there was any kind of error, the interpreter would
just stop evaluating expressions instead of displaying some kind of
warning.

</p><p>
For anyone who just wants to get started immediately, I'll suggest a
few demo and test scripts to take a look at.  If you want to learn how
to use the Gtk functionality in scheme, take a look at snd-texst.scm.
You can find DSP routines in dsp.scm.  For more information on
developing custom applications, take a look at <a
href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/snd/extsnd.html">extsnd.html</a>.
 There is discussion of using vct for speed increases, hooks, how to
make widgets, handling regions and selections, etc.

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>
To demonstrate audio programming in Snd, I've put together a little
DSP script in Guile.  Guile is an implementation of the scheme programming
language. Snd also allows you to write scripts in Ruby. The routine
I've implemented is a basic automatic gain control (AGC) algorithm.
The idea is to prevent the audio from ever getting too loud or too
quiet.  This is done by dividing the magnitude of the samples by the
average magnitude over short a duration.  By default the duration is
256 samples, but I'll show you how to change this later.
</p><p>
The following four procedures implement the algorithm.  The sum-range
procedure recursively sums the samples in the range of samples
specified by start and end.  The second, div-range!, uses the vct-set!
procedure to divide an entire frame of sample values by a single
value.  I also multiply by .1 for scaling reasons.  The zero-range!
procedure is used to zero a frame of samples that has low power.  This
is so AGC doesn't amplify noise or low quality audio.  The meat is in
process-frames!.  It assigns the vector of samples to v and the total
length to len.  Then it enters a loop, stepping one frame at a time.
Each pass through the loop calculates the start and end of the next
frame of samples.  It stores the summation of the range in sum.  Then
it compares the sum against a threshold.  If the sum is too low, it
zeros the range; otherwise, it divides by the sum.  The last
expression sets the samples to the new values.

That's it!  Now what good would this audio effect be if there's no way
to use it?  None.  Fortunately, Snd has wrapped scheme around the Gimp
Toolkit (Gtk) widgets.  This gives me exactly the type of flexibility
I need to make this a useful application.  The usual idiom for
making widgets in C is 
<br /><br />
func(arg1, arg2, ...)
<br /><br />
In Snd it becomes
<br /><br />
(func arg1 arg2 ...)
<br /><br />
The first thing to do is
add a menu option.  Being optimistic that there will be many more
custom routines, I've created a new menu right on the main menu bar
and called it "Todd's Tricks".  Underneath that menu I've added AGC.

</pre>

The next step is to connect the menu to a widget.  I've made a dialog
and placed some widgets in it.  There are a number of boxes to control
the layout of the widgets.  There's also two labels with text
descriptions, two text entry widgets, and a done button.  The text
entry boxes let you enter a file name for saving the new file and a
sample frame size for AGC.  There's a sequence of gtk_box_pack_start
procedures that I've used to carefully lay out the appearance of the
GUI so that it will appear as below.
</p>

<p>
Then the callback handler is made for the done button.  It has a
procedure to read the text entries and run do-agc.  It also hides
the main dialog widget.  The do-agc procedure saves the current audio
selection with the same header type as the original file and 16 bit
samples.  It then opens the file in another frame, runs the AGC
algorithm, and saves back to the file.  The remaining code after the
callback just displays all the widgets.

One other useful trick is to make a keyboard shortcut to the routine.
You can use bind-key for this.  The following code binds C-x a to the
dialog widget just as the menu was tied to it.  Now you can highlight
a portion of audio that interests you and run the AGC algorithm.  It
will ask you for a file name and frame size.  Then it will save the
file and display the results in another window.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
If you need your own custom interface or audio routines, Snd is the
way to go.  I found that I could start developing in it almost
immediately and had created a useful application within a week.  In
addition to its extreme customizability, it comes with many advanced
features built-in or in scripts.  Other than a
slightly-less-than-professional-looking interface, I can't think of
too many reasons to use another editor.
