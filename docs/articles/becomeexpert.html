<h1 class="topofpage">Becoming an Expert</h1>

<p>
So you've decided you want to become an expert in C.  But what does it
mean to be an expert?  Anyone who has done a few projects in C (or any
language) probably has this idea that they're somewhat of an expert,
at least until he or she starts poking around on comp.lang.c for a bit.
</p>
<p>
If I were to start from the beginning, the first thing I would do is
read a book on basics.  Then I would work on some small projects and
then some larger ones.  Eventually I would want to measure my skill
level by asking some of the following questions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I understand what pointers are?</li>
<li>Do I understand multidimensional arrays?</li>
<li>Do I understand the relationship between  pointers and arrays.</li>
<li>Do I understand pointer arithmetic?</li>
<li>Can I declare and use complex types (pointers to arrays, arrays of
pointers, arrays returning pointers to functions, etc.).</li>
<li>Do I understand both static and dynamic memory allocation?</li>
<li>Am I familiar with all the basic control structures?</li>
<li>Do I understand how to use structures?</li>
<li>Do I understand functions, stacks, and heaps?</li>
<li>Do I know how to work with low level bit manipulation
operations?</li>
<li>How well do I know the precedence of operators?</li>
</ul>

<p>
If I found myself answering yes to these questions, I would say this
is a good start.  But how about the standard libraries?  What good is
knowing the language without some libraries?  Am I familiar with all
the standard headers and the functions, variables, and constants in
each one.  Do I know how to use the functions?  Am I familiar with the
design issues and quirks of the library?
</p>

<p>
It's good to know the libraries and the language.  But am I familiar
with the official standards, C89 and C99?  Assuming I knew some
compiler theory, could I implement a compiler that conforms to these
standards?  Can I write code that will work on any conforming
compiler?  Do I know what is C and what is a language extension by my
particular compiler?
</p>

<p>
knowing the standards is good.  But it sure would be nice if I
understood how to write real world code.  Writing some short projects
isn't quite the same thing as working on a project that's tens of
thousands of lines or even hundreds of thousands of lines of code.
It's also a good idea to review other code to see how problems are
commonly solved in C.
</p>

<p>
For maximum exposure, I would want to work on various types of
projects.  I would write some networking code, implement some data
structures and numerical algorithms, work on some human interface code
(GUI, command line), etc.  Different types of problems tell you about
the language's strengths and weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
But I really need something to compare to.  This means I should also
be familiar with at least two or three other languages as well.  After
all, how am I supposed to know about C's efficiency without comparing
it to a language like Python.  And how would I know that pointers and
memory allocation and null characters are all things I could often do
without if I hadn't tried a higher level language?
</p>

<p>
And still there's more.  Don't you agree that I should learn something
about the history of C?  How did it evolve?  Why can I not add
character strings?  Why can I add pointers?  How were these decisions
made?  Why were the standards made the way they were.  Understanding
these questions helps me understand the language.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I should learn something about my specific compiler.
Understanding the various compiler options should help me understand
the language better.  Do I know how various compilers differ and why?
Which features conform to standards and which ones don't?  Do I
understand how the compiler works with the linker?  What
responsibilities belong to the compiler and which to the linker?
</p>

<p>
Maybe you can think of more ways to improve your skill and
understanding.  Go and hang out at comp.lang.c.  Read the FAQ.
Experiment.  Read code.  Study solutions to difficult problems solved
in C.  Implement the same code in multiple langauges.  Read through
the libraries.  Read the standard.  If you do even half of these
things, you'll probably know far more than me.
