<h1 class="topofpage">Ocaml and You</h1>

<p>
Start out with <span class="bold">emerge ocaml</span>.  This will get
you the language fully installed and the xemacs packages.  You will
want to install ocamlfind, which is also known as findlib.  Install
with <span class="bold">emerge findlib</span>.  This is needed to
install and use extension packages, such as Getopt.
</p>

<p>
To compile your program into a bytecode executable, run <span
class="bold">ocamlc myprog.ml</span>.  This makes an executable file
that invokes the interpreter, ocamlrun, to execute the bytecodes.  If
you want a native version (doesn't require ocamlrun), use <span
class="bold">ocamlopt myprog.ml</span>.
</p>

<p>
If you need thread support*, you need to use <span class="bold">open
Thread</span> in your code and give the -thread option to the compiler.
This will ensure that the compiler links in the thread safe version of
the libraries.  You will also need to add -custom threads.cma.  But
threads depends on the unix module; so, add unix before threads.  Now
you have <span class="bold">ocamlc -thread -custom unix.cma
threads.cma myprog.ml</span>.
</p>

<p>
To get any real work done, you'll probably need to use the
lexer/parser.  Include <span class="bold">open Genlex</span> in your
code.  Add <span class="bold">-pp camlp4o -I +camlp4</span> to the
compile options.  This tells the compiler to preparse the file with
camlp4o.  The -I tells it to include the camlp4 directory when
searching for cma and cmo files.
</p>

<p>
If you're going to be writing any decently large sized program, you'll
also want to use <a
href="http://www.eleves.ens.fr/home/frisch/soft.html">getopts</a>.
Getopts is a standard C library for parsing the input parameters sent to an
executable.  Run the following.  Then take a look at sample.ml and the
docs in docs/index.html.
</p>

<pre>
make 
make allopt
make install

(* Verify Getopt is installed by running ocaml. *)
#use "topfind";;
#list;; (* should show getopt *)
#require "Getopt";;
</pre>

<p>
The final compile command looks like <span class="bold">ocamlc -thread
-custom unix.cma threads.cma getopt.cma -pp camlp4o -I +camlp4 -I
getopt myprog.ml</span>.  If you want to compile to native code, use
<span class="bold">ocamlopt -thread  -pp camlp4o -I +camlp4 -I getopt
unix.cmxa threads.cmxa getopt.cmxa myprog.ml</span>.  According to the
documentation you also need to add <span class="bold">-cclib -lunix
-cclib -lthreads</span> to the ocamlc command line and <span
class="bold">-cclib -lunix  -cclib -lthreadsnat  -cclib
-lpthread</span> to the ocamlopt command line.  However, I didn't find
this to be necessary.
</p>

<p>
<span class="bold">*Threads</span><br />
Threads in Ocaml cannot run on more than one processor.  So you
probably won't get much of a speed increase by using them.  Also, for
some reason, I found that if you print from within a thread, the
output does not show up on the console if the main thread quits.  I
assume this means all threads are immediately terminated (at least by
default) when the main program ends.  If you put a delay in the main
program, the output will appear on the console <span
class="italics">after</span> the delay.  However, you can make the
output appear immediately by putting <span class="bold">%!</span> in
your formatted string.  This tells printf to flush immediately.
