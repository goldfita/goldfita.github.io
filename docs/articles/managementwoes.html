<h1 class="topofpage">Management Woes</h1>

<p>
Let's talk about John.  John decided one day that he was going to make a
living by starting a small retail store selling shoes.  After a few
years of hard work, he realized he could no longer run the business by
himself.  He hired someone to work the floor, helping customers so
that he could focus on the  more difficult tasks of running the
business.  As the business grew, John hired more low level customer
service people.  He also hired someone to handle finances.  Eventually
he needed marketing people, payroll, and management.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, John's little venture was quite successful.  He is now
the wealthy president of the company.  The only work he does anymore
is making decisions.  In order to succeed, he had to learn to manage
both people and the company as it grew.  But John didn't just get
dumped into a management position.  At every step of the way he had
hands on experience with every part of the business.  He was the low
level customer support.  He handled finances.  He was his own
salesman.  He dealt with paperwork, hiring, and managing low and high
level workers.  Sure, he was doing most tasks part-time.  It was
often clumsy, inaccurate, and lacking the kind of quality that his
subordinates now put into that work.  But he had (and still has) a
basic understanding of what everyone in the company does.
</p>

<p>
This is an ideal.  John is a true leader.  He not only makes the hard
decisions, but he could do the work himself.  That is, he can perform
not only management tasks, but he could, if necessary, put himself in
anyone else's shoes and take over for them.  Unfortunately, when John
leaves, his predecessor may not have had his experiences.  Perhaps the
CFO will take over.  But the CFO has had only financial experience.
Maybe someone who started their own company will be brought in, but he
may have been in a very different industry.
</p>

<p>
Let's talk about Jane.  Jane was hired by a large company as an
engineer.  She was brilliant.  In fact, she was so brilliant, within a
few years she was running her own specialized lab with just a handful
of other people helping her.  She turned a proposal costing $50,000
into $50,000,000 in a just a few years.  Management was ecstatic.
They moved her into another department to manage 300 people.  Within a
year she left to get a phd and become a professor.  She vowed never to
return.  It took two years to replace Jane, but by then her program
had already deteriorated.
</p>

<p>
After losing a number of Janes, management began to wonder what they
were doing wrong.  Finally, someone proposed that maybe Jane actually
liked doing the work instead of telling other people to do the work.
It was difficult to accept.  But management conceded and setup a
program so that their Janes could progress in the company without
becoming managers themselves.  It was a fabulous success.
</p>

<p>
So we have John and Jane.  But what about the case of a company whose
business is technology?  Who should manage?  Jane who either can't or
doesn't want to or John who sells shoes but knows nothing of technology?
Maybe it's a difficult question, but fortunately, there are plenty of
engineers who both have the ability and desire to manage.  But it
seems to me a tragedy when non-technical people are placed in charge
of the technical minded.  You no longer have the situation where the
leader has all the skills of the subordinates.  Instead you have two
entirely separate skill sets.  But the more knowledgeable people have
the least power.  
</p>

<p>
It's generally better if the manager is himself technically oriented.
But it depends on the situation.  If you manage a team that designs
auto bodies for cars, it's less important.  This is a concrete thing
that everyone has experience with.  Everyone knows what a car is and
how they're used.  Any intelligent person should be able to understand
the implications of a lighter, more aerodynamic frame.  If instead
your team has developed a new programming language, then it's more
important that you understand programming.  Maybe this new
language is going to change the way software development is done.
You'll sell a million compilers.  Consulting will start at $300 per
hour.  There will be books and training programs.  Soon customers will
ask for debuggers and IDEs.  And then they'll be forced to upgrade
when version 2.0 is released.  But how can you understand any of this
if you've never written a line of code?  This is more abstract.  It's
something only engineers use.  You've never seen, touched, or used it.
</p>

<p>
It would be a strange experience coming into a company where you know
more than your boss.  Who will mentor you?  Your fresh-out-of-college
co-workers?  Imagine if John's first employee was constantly needing
to explain to John how things work instead of the other way around.
Wouldn't it seem more like they should be working side by side?
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, a non-technical manager has no understanding of the
project he's managing beyond the interface.  He can't understand how
difficult the work is, the risks involved, the time scale to do the
work, etc.  He may not understand just how creative and useful the
software (or hardware) is.  If a difficult problem is solved, but the
solution isn't exposed to the interface, he may be completely unaware
of it.
</p>

<p>
It gets even worse if management is far removed from engineering and
they have no technical competence.  They're running a company they
don't understand at all and have no contact with the people who are
the reason the company exists.  How can this be?
</p>

<p>
Consider successes that were started by engineers, like Microsoft and
Google.  Microsoft is still run by technical people.  A physicist
founded a very successful research center, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_PARC">Xerox PARC</a>.  But supposedly
it was management at Xerox who failed to understand the benefits of
the technology they had.
</p>

<p>
I am reading all the time about the increasing requirements asked of
engineers.  Not only is ever expanding technical ability within the
engineer's field asked of him, but more abilities outside his field
are required now too.  It's not good enough to be an engineer; you
also have to be a sales person, have business experience, and have management
ability.  This is backwards!  Unless you are going into management,
you don't need to have these skills.  Your boss should know what you
know and more, not the other way around.  Thus your boss should learn
engineering.  The burden of responsibility is being shifted onto the
wrong people.  This is not a good solution.
</p>

<p>
The best thing to do is put engineers in charge of engineers.  There
aren't too many brilliant engineers who are also brilliant leaders.
But, the manager doesn't need to be brilliant.  Like John, it's enough
if he just understands the basics.  But to have no competence at all
is asking for trouble.
