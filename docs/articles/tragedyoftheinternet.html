<h1 class="topofpage">Tragedy of the Internet</h1>
<p>
The Internet, I have learned, is a strange place.  The incredible
power of mass communications tends to re-balance the playing field.  In
fact, it often inverts it.  The predator becomes the prey and the
prey the predator.
</p><p>
For example take spammers.  Offline, it's at their expense to send you
junk.  It's simply to expensive and time consuming to send mail to a
billion people every day.  Online, it's trivial.  The spammer has
transferred his work load to the spammees.  It's the people receiving
the spam that now have to put in the effort to search through their e-mail.
</p><p>
Similarly, on the Internet, men could proposition every single woman
on dating sites.  Why not?  It's easy to do, and you have nothing to
lose.  This is physically impossible offline.  It then becomes the
women's responsibility to figure out who to respond to.  The roles
have swapped.
</p><p>
When sending your resume to employers, you might as well send it to
everyone.  Then it's the employers responsibility to read through all
the resumes.  The work has shifted from job seeker to employer.
</p><p>
In some ways this is a good thing.  Employers now have more options
then they otherwise would have had.  On the other hand, there's a lot
more noise.
</p><p>

If you're familiar with the <a
href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~rdeyoung/tragedy.html">Tragedy of
the Commons</a>, you might see some parallels here.  Everyone is doing
what makes the most sense for him or her, and it's basically harmless
in small numbers, but the Internet as a whole
tends to suffer.  I'm calling it the Tragedy of the Internet.
