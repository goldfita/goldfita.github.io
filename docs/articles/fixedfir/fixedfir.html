<p>
I'll assume you know what an FIR filter is and how to write a mex
file.  You should be able to follow even if you can't write a mex
file.  Take a look at the <a href="fpfir.c">code</a>.  It implements
an eight point FIR filter with a sign bit and 15 decimal bits.  The
accumulator is 30 bits, but it's converted back to 16 bits after the
sum is complete.  This happens at accum>>15.  Assuming we're not going
to worry about overflow any, the rest of the fixed point logic is the
same as the floating point logic.  But you just need to make sure to
convert from floating point to fixed point and then back.  This is
done by multiplying by 15 bits (2^15) to convert to fixed.  Then
divide by 2^15 on the way out.

The drawings above show the first two stages of the FIR filter.  It
uses a rotating buffer.  The 'start' indexing variable always points
to the start of the delay line.  So in the first picture, start is
really at the start.  If you look at the code, you'll see that it's
decremented each cycle of the loop.  So, it iterates backwards over
the loop, wrapping back to the beginning when it reaches the end.  The
filter tap index always starts at 0 and increments all the way through
to the end.  In the second picture, start is pointing to the second
element.  This is where the new sample is placed.  So x1 is multiplied
by h0 and x0 is multiplied by h1 - x1h0+x0h1.  The next iteration
would be x2h0+x1h1+x0h3 with start after the second delay.  Notice
that the variable that loops through the accumulation is also the
start pointer variable.  This means the loop has to stop one iteration
early so that the start variable ends up rotating positively through
the array after each accumulation.  By the time x0 is overwritten, it
will have passed through the filter; so, we don't need to worry about
it.  That's how circular addressing works.  You make the delay line
just long enough so that when the oldest data point is no longer
needed, it gets overwritten.

It is convenient to do this in matlab (if you can get access to it)
for testing reasons.  The plot below shows the error between matlab's
double precision filter and the one implemented here.  You can see
from the <a href="fixed.m">matlab code</a> that the original signal
had a max of just under one.  I kept this function simple so I didn't
have to spend all night working on it.  Here are a few improvements
you can make.  You might try an even more optimized <a
href="http://dspguru.com/sw/opendsp/alglib.htm">algorithm</a>.  You
could modify it to work similar to matlab's filter function.  You'll
need to make the filter variable length.  And you'll have to pass it
in with the signal.  You'll also have to pass in the delay line.  That
way you don't have to do the filtering all in one giant block.  You
might consider making it IIR.  You could set the number of fixed point
bits from a function parameter.
