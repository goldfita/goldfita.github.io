<h1 class="topofpage">Some Things that Help</h1>
<p>
These are some mistakes I've made over the years.  Only after doing
things the wrong way for a few months or years did I finally realize
what I should have been doing.  Or someone smarter was kind enough to
tell me.  Hopefully the suggestions below will be helpful.  I know I
intend to try them.</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Document everything.  Even better, write scripts to do the
installation for you.  If you're anything like me and can't remember
configuration and setup information for more than about 3 hours, this
will save you a lot of time.  As soon as you figure out all the steps
involved in installing a new package, make a script that does it for
you.  This has a number of advantages.  Obviously, you'll never have
to do it again (unless you install a different version or on a
different OS).  It gives you something you can post to your web site.
If you learned something new during the installation, you have your
script to refer back to, and it's easier to understand code you've
written than someone else's example.
</p>
<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>
Initialize everything, even if you don't need to.  Initialize
immediately, even if you'll be doing so again just below.  Bugs that involve
random initialization values are not fun to track down.  You might
not need to initialize now, but later after you make some changes,
you'll be glad you did.  Or at least you would have been very sad if
you didn't.
</p>
<h3>Type size</h3>
<p>
Start with the largest reasonable type.  I know you think you're safe
now, but wait a few months and 5000 lines of code later.  If you
really need to make a type smaller, do it only when it has to be done.
If this causes a problem, it may show up immediately.
</p>
<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>
Die violently.  Make as much noise as possible.  Have you ever found
yourself writing code that attempts to hide error messages and cover up
the fact that something bad happened?  I have and I've seen it done.
Don't do it.  If something goes wrong, you want the entire world to
know.  When one thing goes wrong, it's only a matter of time before
others follow.  You don't want to obscure the original error.
</p>
<p>When should you check for invalid data?  Inside the function, or
outside?  Unless speed is really important, I suggest both.
</p><p>
Write error handling code immediately.  You'll forget to do it
later.  It will come back to bite you.  Even if you don't know how to
handle the problem yet, put something there.
</p>
<h3>Introspection</h3>
<p>
Meta data is good.  Use lots of it.  The mistake I make is usually not
keeping enough data around to know the state of the program.  In fact
I tend to do quite the opposite, and strip data structures down to the
bare minimum.  Don't do that.  This is especially problematic when
you're using threads and they need to talk to each other.
</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
When you find information on the internet on how to accomplish a
programming task, copy the link into a comment.  Even if you don't
need to revisit that link, someone else might.  It only takes a second,
and someone will be glad you did it.
</p>
<h3>Experiments</h3>

<p>Keep a directory around for code experiments.  When you don't
understand how something works or you can't find decent documentation
(or it's just wrong), make a little experiment file.  This is what a
scientist does.  Only you've got it easier because someone (at least
at one point) understands how it works, and there is probably some
documentation.  Keep your experiments around so you can refer to them
later.  And again, this gives you some content for your web site.  You
never know who else might find your little example helpful.  Here is
an example <a href="exp/python/exper1.py">script</a> (and <a
href="exp/python/exper2.py">another</a>) that demonstrates multiple inheritance
in python.
</p>

<h3>Learn the tools</h3>
<p>Take the time to understand the tools you use regularly.  If you find
yourself using the same tool over and over, learn how to actually use
it properly.  Often you'll only use a tool a few times and you don't
want to take the time to learn it.  That's ok.  But if you later find
that one or two times has turned into 60, it's time to spend a few
hours learning how to really use it.
</p>

<h3>Document the Details</h3> <p>Whenever you learn a little quirk
about your code or design, write it down somewhere.  It's all those
little things that cause you to sit there forever trying to figure out
what in the world is going on.  When you fix a bug, explain what you
did and why you did it.  If you don't do this, someone else (or even
you) may come by at a later time and CHANGE IT BACK!  That's bad.
Don't keep it in your head.  Tell the world.
</p>

<h3>Customize Your Environment</h3>
<p>
I've found myself customizing and recustomizing my .emacs, .bashrc,
and .bash_profile.  Each time it's a little different.  Take the time
to customize your environment the way you want it.  Then put the
customizations in a convenient place.  I have mine backed up on my
website so that I can access them from anywhere.  I just drop my .emacs
into /usr/share/emacs and create a link to it for any user on the
machine I want to use.  And I only need to update it once for all users.
</p>

<h3>Record Your History</h3>
<p>
Keep a file around to store recent or unusual commands.  I started
storing new and/or long shell commands in a file, linuxcommands.txt.
I have already found it to be invaluable and have refered to it a
number of times.  And it's only been a few weeks!  Imagine how useful
it will be a year from now.  Also, if you insist on using <span
class="bold">echo "my cool command" >> linuxcommands.txt</span> to
append to files, make sure you keep frequent backups.  I've already
forgoten the second greater than sign once.
