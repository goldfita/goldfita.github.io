<h1 class="topofpage">Matlab Convolution</h1>
<p>
This is a quick look at convolution and deconvolution in matlab.
First you might have wondered, as I have, what's the deal with
flipping the filter?  It's really simple if you just think about the
physical phenomenon.  Suppose you have a filter modeling what a
circuit or room does to an electric or acoustic signal.  Picture the
wave hitting the filter.  Does the back of one hit the front of the
other first?  No!  They first touch head-to-head (first sample to
first sample).  The only way to get that behaviour is by either
flipping the filter or the signal.</p>

<p> I'm not going to write the
definition of convolution.  I'm sure you've seen it.  I'll just put
the discrete example here.
</p>
<pre class="code">
h = [1 2 3]
x = [4 5 6]

    4 5 6 
   -------
3 2|1    |4  <- first output
  3|2 1  |13
   |3 2 1|28 <- last output for filter
   |  3 2|27
   |    3|18 <- last output for conv

c = conv(h,x) -> [4 13 28 27 18]
filter(h,1,x) -> [4 13 28]
</pre>
<p>
And the last two values, [27 18], are in the filter delay line.<br /><br />

<p>
You're probably also familiar with the polynomial multiplication trick.  This procedure turns out to be the same way you multiply polynomials.
</p>
<pre class="code">
(1x^2+2x^1+3x^0)*(4x^2+5x^1+6x^0) ->

(1*4)x^4+(1*5+2*4)x^3+(1*6+2*5+3*4)x^2+(2*6+3*5)x^1+(3*6)x^0 ->

4x^4+13x^3+28x^2+27x^1+18*x^0
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, you can do polynomial division using deconv.  If you take a
look at the matlab deconv function (type deconv), it implements deconv
using filter.<br /><br />

filter(c, h, [1 zeros(1,lenc-lenh)]) -> [4 5 6]<br /><br />

In the z domain, this is equivalent to C(z)/H(z)*1.  The 1 comes from
the transform of the kronecker delta.  The degree of the output
polynomial is the degree of the numerator polynomial minus the degree
of the denominator polynomial plus one.  Since the output of filter is
the same length as the signal, the correct output is gotten using
zeros(1,lenc-lenh) (plus the starting one).  Notice that I can rewrite
the polynomial as 1/H(z)*C(z).  This would be<br /><br />

filter(1, h, c(1:length(x))) -> [4 5 6]<br /><br />

You have to be careful about stability however.  Whenever I tried
divide by the larger sequence (in this case they are both length 3) I
ran in to stability problems using both forms.
