<h1 class="topofpage">Latex Figures</h1>

<p>
From looking at my log files, I've noticed a number of people
searching for information about latex figures.  I hope they haven't
been too disappointed with the sentence or two I wrote about that.
I've decided to write something a little more in depth.
</p>

<p>
Dealing with images and figures in latex was the most difficult part of formatting
my thesis.  I learned a few things along the way, such as don't take a
screen shot of your matlab figures.  Either save them as figures and
convert in gimp, or export as postscript from matlab if you can.
Otherwise, you'll end up with low resolution images.  I also learned
a little bit about positioning images in figures, changing captions,
and dealing with multi-page figures.
</p>

<p>
There are a couple ways to build a pdf from a tex file.  The first
requires you to build a ps file first.<br />
latex fig1.tex<br />
dvips -Ppdf fig1.dvi<br />
ps2pdf fig1.ps<br />
The other way is to use pdflatex.  I believe if you use the first
method, the images in the pdf and ps files will look the same.  But
the images may look different if you generate the pdfs using different
methods.  I drew a red border around the flower so you can see where
the difference is.  Be careful, though.  In kpdf, I discovered resizing
the pages would make a difference in how much of the image was
displayed.  If I made the size too small, the right side of the border
I drew wasn't visible, even though it was actually there.
<br /><br />
<a href="fig3_1.png">Method 1</a><br />
<a href="fig1_1.png">Method 2</a>
</p>

<p>
The code for these images is
</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="flkf">
\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}[htb]
<span class="flkf">\caption</span>{view (0,0,580,480)}
<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flcf">%left,bottom,right,top
</span><span class="flkf">\includegraphics</span>[totalheight=1<span
class="flkf">\textheight</span>,
width=1<span class="flkf">\textwidth</span>,viewport=0 0 580 480,clip]{flower}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}
<span class="flkf">\clearpage</span>
</pre>

<p>
Make sure to move the caption and label outside the center environment.  It
doesn't appear to matter in my current version of latex.  But in the
version I used for my thesis, if I put the label inside the center
environment, the reference would be wrong.
</p>

<p>
The interesting statement here is <span
class="bold">\includegraphics[totalheight=1\textheight,
width=1\textwidth,viewport=0
0 580 480,clip]{flower}</span>.  This says to make the image fill the
width and height of the text area on the page.  The viewport clips the
image.  The first number is pixels from the left.  Next is from the
bottom, then to the right, and final to the top.  Often, you'll have
to set the viewport, or only a piece of the image will display.  It
depends on the original format of the image.
</p>

<p>
Also notice I didn't specify an extension for the image file name.  I put
flower.eps and flower.pdf (using ps2pdf) in the directory.  If you use
the graphicx package, don't specify an extension with includegraphics
and it will figure out if you want the (e)ps or pdf file.
</p>

<p>
I clipped the photo a little short on top and right sides in the next
image.  Notice the red border isn't showing.
<br /><br />
<a href="fig1_2.png">Clipped right and top</a>
</p>

<p>
Next I clipped it on all sides.  It's clear now that the physical size
of the image is the same, but the image has been resized to fit.  The
only change between that and the next image is that I removed clip.
Instead of clipping the image at the viewport boundary, the image was
resized within the physical boundary but the rest of it was still
displayed.  In this case it covered the whole page.
<br /><br />
<a href="fig1_3.png">Clipped on all sides</a><br />
<a href="fig1_4.png">Clipped on all sides (but without clip)</a>
</p>

<p>
Then I removed the includegraphics options altogether.  After that, only the viewport
was removed.  Following that are image with
only the height specified and only the width, respectively.
<br /><br />
<a href="fig1_5.png">No options</a><br />
<a href="fig1_6.png">No viewport</a><br />
<a href="fig1_7.png">Height only</a><br />
<a href="fig1_8.png">Width only</a>
</p>

<p>
This last one is with the height and width set to .5.  The entire
image is still displayed, but it's smaller.
<br /><br />
<a href="fig1_9.png">Half height and width</a>
</p>

<p>
You might get a silly idea in your head, as I did, that you want to
change the way captions work, or you want to display multiple images
in one figure that may span more than a page.  The following code does
two new things.  It changes the start of the caption by redefining
<span class="bold">\fnum@figure</span>.  If you do this, you have to
remember to change it back later.  It also puts two images on one page
by using separate figures.  The problem is there is a lot of space
between the figures.
</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="flkf">
\makeatletter</span> <span class="flkf">\renewcommand</span>{<span
class="flkf">\fnum@figure</span>}
{New caption for figure <span class="flkf">\thefigure</span>} <span class="flkf">\makeatother</span>
<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}[htb]
<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\includegraphics</span>[totalheight=.3<span
class="flkf">\textheight</span>,
width=.7<span class="flkf">\textwidth</span>,viewport=0 0 580 480]{flower}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}

<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}[htb]
<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\includegraphics</span>[totalheight=.3<span
class="flkf">\textheight</span>,
width=.7<span class="flkf">\textwidth</span>,viewport=0 0 580 480]{flower}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\caption</span>{(inside caption)}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}
<span class="flkf">\clearpage</span>
</pre>


<p>
<a href="fig2_1.png">Two figures</a>
<br /><br />
So instead, place both images in a single figure.  That removes the
space.  But what if I want to make the images bigger?  Then the figure
might split into two pages.  But when I increase the height, one image
just gets clipped at the bottom of the page.  You need to include the
subfig package and use <span class="bold">\ContinuedFloat</span>.
Add this to a figure and it will be considered part of the last figure.
Also notice I created some blank captions.  This will ensure the
figure gets numbered.
</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="flkf">
\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}[htb]
<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\includegraphics</span>[totalheight=.7<span
class="flkf">\textheight</span>,
width=.7<span class="flkf">\textwidth</span>,viewport=0 0 580 480]{flower}
<span class="flkf">\caption</span>[]{}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}

<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}[htb]
<span class="flkf">\ContinuedFloat</span>
<span class="flkf">\begin</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\includegraphics</span>[totalheight=.7<span
class="flkf">\textheight</span>,
width=.7<span class="flkf">\textwidth</span>,viewport=0 0 580 480]{flower}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">center</span>}
<span class="flkf">\caption</span>[]{}
<span class="flkf">\end</span>{<span class="flfnf">figure</span>}
<span class="flkf">\clearpage</span>
</pre>

<p>
<a href="fig2_2.png">One figure, two images</a><br />
<a href="fig2_3.png">One figure, two large images</a><br />
<a href="fig2_4a.png">Two figures numbered as one (A)</a><br />
<a href="fig2_4b.png">Two figures numbered as one (B)</a>

<p>
The default latex install doesn't come with the subfig package.  Here
are the steps I took in gentoo to install it.  I had to first install the latest
caption package before subfig would build.  Your experience may be
different.  You can also put the sty files in the directory with your
latex file, but you'll need to do a system-wide install if you want to
be use the packages from anywhere.
</p>

<p>
First, make sure you have <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps/">a2ps</a>.  If not, <span
class="bold">emerge a2ps</span>.  Unzip the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/">caption</a>
package and follow the directions <a
href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages">here</a>
to build.  Copy caption.sty, caption2.sty, and caption3.sty to
/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/caption.  You might want to backup any
caption files allready in there.  Run texhash.
</p>

<p>
Unzip the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/">subfig</a>
package and type <span class="bold">make</span>.  Make a subfig
directory in /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/.  Copy subfig.sty there.  And
run texhash again.  That should be it.
