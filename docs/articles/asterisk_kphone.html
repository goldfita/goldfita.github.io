<p>
I had tried a number of times to get a softphone working in <a
href="http://www.asterisk.org">Asterisk</a>.  Softphones are just
software versions of VoIP phones.  I was finally able to get <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/kphone">kphone</a> registered
and working.  <a
href="http://www.twinklephone.com/">Twinkle</a> still isn't working
for me.
</p>
<p>
The first problem I had was getting the phones to talk to Asterisk at
all.  I just wasn't seeing any output on the Asterisk console.  If I
set qualify=yes or to some positive number, I got the errors below.
If this occurred, I had to stop Asterisk to start Twinkle.  It was
complaining about the port already being in use.

</p>

<p>
It turned out that either the softphones or Asterisk didn't like the
fact that my machine didn't have a fully qualified domain name.
Either it was that or it was because I was using an IP.  The next
problem I had was that the phone still refused to register.  A little
more research and I found out you have to set host=dynamic.  I had it
set to the IP or domain name.  I'm still not sure what the problem is.
 Perhaps it was somehow trying to find an external IP.

<p>
My sip.conf that finally worked with kphone is  below.  You can also
uncomment username and secret.  Kphone will ask you for this information.
