<h1 class="topofpage">*NIX Shared Libraries</h1>

<p>
Over the last few years, shared object files have given me a number of
headaches.  This last project gave me good reason to at least learn
the basics.  It's not at all obvious how these things work, but there
is a good reason it's done this way.  Check out the links at the
bottom for more information.  The only problem with the other
descriptions is they're seriously lacking some pictures.  And no one
bothered to explain the different methods of using .so files.
</p><p>
So what are those .so files?  They're shared libraries.  Usually when
you compile c programs, the compiler generates an object file (foo.o).
It then passes all the object files onto the linker (ld) to build an
executable. Shared objects allow multiple executables to use the same
object code.  A lot of code (like your standard c libraries) is used
by almost every (or many) applications.  There is no need to link a
different copy of the code into every executable.  There are also
static libraries, which are just archives of .o files.  I'm going to
go over that briefly first.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Assuming your file is named foo and is stored in the foo variable, a
dependency line in a Makefile might look like this.  This says
libfoo.a depends on foo.o.  Assuming foo.o was just compiled somewhere
else, the line below will execute.  The 'ar' tool is an archive utility.
The rcs option stands for r - insert into archive, c - create archive,
s - create archive index.  Thus make executes 'ar rcs libfoo.a foo.o'
which builds the archive libfoo.a from the single object file foo.o.
(Normally you would put more than one file into the archive.)
</p>
<pre class="code">
lib$(foo).a: $(foo).o
	ar rcs $@ $&lt;
</pre>

<p>
The next line says the executable, dofoo, depends on libfoo.a and
dofoo.c.  We are going to build the object file for our program,
dofoo.c, and link it in with the library, libfoo.a  Afterwords, all
the code will be merged into the executable.  The line beneath expands
to 'gcc -Wall dofoo.c -o dofoo -L. -lfoo  -lsocket -lnsl
'.  The options from left to right are:<br /><br />
(1) compile using gcc with all warnings messages,<br />
(2) output to dofoo (-o $@)<br />
(3) tell the linker to look for libraries in the current directory
(-L.)<br />
(4) link libfoo.a (-l$(foo))<br />
(5) also use libsocket and libnsl<br />
</p><p>

Now we see why I called the library libfoo.a instead of foo.a.  The
linker assumes the 'lib' part.  You don't use 'lib' with the -l
option*.  The linker puts it on there for you.  You can, of course,
also link libfoo.a in with other programs, but you'll have many copies
of the same code all over the place.  Think of it as having a few
copies of Moby Dick in every room in your house.
</p>
<pre class="code">
dofoo: lib$(foo).a dofoo.c
	$(CC) $(flags) $@.c -o $@ -L. -l$(foo)  -lsocket -lnsl
</pre>


<hr />

<p>
So you've decided you never really liked whales anyway.  You'll want
to make a shared object.  This is where the fun starts.  If you've
ever taken a peak at /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib, you probably saw lots
of funny looking file links like libfoo.so.1 and libfoo.so.1.3.0.
It's done this way for compatibility.  Those numbers on the end are
version numbers+.  In the most general form when a library, say
libfoo.so, is released there will be four files involved -- libfoo.so,
libfoo.so.#, libfoo.so.#.#, and libfoo.so.#.#.# (apparently there can
be even more).  The first number is the major version, followed by the
minor version, and then a very minor version.  I'll ignore the last
file.  The file with the most numbers at the end is a real file.  The
others are just links.
</p>
<pre>
libfoo.so     --> libfoo.so.2.4
libfoo.so.2   --> libfoo.so.2.4
libfoo.so.2.4
</pre>
<p>
Now why in the heck would you want to do that?  You need to understand
what the linker does first.  When you run an executable, a loader has
to figure out what shared object files your executable needs and where
they're located.  It works out that some or all of that information is
in the executable itself.  But how did it get in there?  (I'll give
you a clue -- Herman Melville didn't put it there.)  Your linker did
all the magic stuff.  Of course you told it what to do.  When you
create the shared object file, the name of the file ends up IN the
file, if you did things right.
</p>
<pre class="code">
$(foo).o: $(foo).c
	$(CC) $(FLAGS) -fPIC -c $&lt;
</pre>
<p>
This time I made the object file using -fPIC, meaning Position
Independent Code.  And the -c means just make an object file.  You can
then make an so out it.  I had a problem doing this with gcc on
Solaris.  But apparently it's ok to use just the linker, ld, on
Solaris.  Usually you want to let gcc handle the linker for you.
</p>
<pre class="code">
MAJOR=1
MINOR=0
FULLVER=$(MAJOR).$(MINOR)
VER=$(MAJOR)
lib$(foo).so: $(foo).o
	ld -G -soname=$@.1  -o $@.$(FULLVER) $(foo).o 
	ln $@.$(FULLVER) $@.$(VER)
	ln $@.$(FULLVER) $@
</pre>
<p>
This creates the .so file from the .o file.  The -soname tells ld the
name you want to put inside the .so file.  If you leave it out, it
won't end up in there.  The next two commands link the files in the
way I mentioned above.  Now is a good time to verify what I'm
saying. Open the so up in emacs.  Type 'M-x hexl-mode' and then 'C-s
foolib.so'.  You may need to hit 'C-s' a few times.  You should see
what you specified in the soname linker option.  Take it out and try
that again.
</p><p>
Now you have a shared object file that can be used by executables, but
you still have to link the shared object file against the executable.
Usually this step would combine all the object files together to build
the executable.  But since you aren't putting any code from the so
into the executable, the linker is just going to check and make sure
everything is ok and copy the the so name from the so into the
executable.    In an elf executable, it will be stored in the DT_SONAME
field.
</p>
<pre class="code">
$(foo): lib$(foo).so $(foo).c
	$(CC) $(FLAGS) $@.c \
        -Wl,-R/Users/class02/goldfita/content -L. -o $@  -l$(foo)
</pre>
<p>
This says the executable, foo, depends on libfoo.so and foo.c.  It
runs the command 'gcc -Wall foo.c
-Wl,-R/Users/class02/goldfita/content -L. -o foo -lfoo'.  This says
compile foo.c, link the libfoo library (-lfoo) by searching for it in
the current directory (-L.), and link using the options in -Wl.  GCC
invokes the linker for you, and the -Wl command passes options to the
linker (that's an 'ell').  The linker sees
-R/Users/class02/goldfita/content.  That path ends up in the
executable after the so name and it tells the loader where to look for
the so (make sure the path is touching -R).  You can specify more than
one path.  The loader will also look in /usr/lib and check the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  Open up the executable and
search for the path and the soname.  The linker should have copied the soname
from the so to the executable.  If there wasn't an soname in the so,
the linker will probably just use the name of the file (try it).
</p><p>
Now the OS has everything it needs.  When you go to run the file, the
loader knows exactly what to do.  Try 'ldd foo'.  It should show you
the library name and where it's located.  Try it again, but don't
specify the -Wl option this time.  Now do you see the issue?
</p><p>
If you remember, once upon a time several paragraphs ago, I was
talking about file links and version numbers.  It's time to clarify.
Usually you put the major version of the shared object file name in
the executable (as I did) -- that's libfoo.so.1 in my example
above.  This points to the real file, libfoo.so.1.0.  That's because
at some time in the future there might be a major version release and
we DON'T want the executable to point to the new shared object.
Usually a new major version indicates a significant change, like a new
interface.  This would break the executable.  So we now have
</p>
<pre>
libfoo.so     --> libfoo.so.3.1
libfoo.so.2   --> libfoo.so.2.4
libfoo.so.3   --> libfoo.so.3.1
libfoo.so.2.4
libfoo.so.3.1
</pre>
<p>
If DT_SONAME in the executable is libfoo.so.2, the loader looks for
libfoo.so.2, which points to libfoo.so.2.4.  So even with the upgrade
to libfoo.so.3.1, everything is ok.  But a new file that needs version
3 will tell the loader to look for libfoo.so.3 which points to
libfoo.so.3.1.  Everyone is happy, but what about libfoo.so and
libfoo.so.2.4?  The reason for libfoo.so is so you can link against it
and never need to change a Makefile, even if you change the code
to use a new version of the library.  Look at the example above.  Try
removing <span class="nobr">'ln $@.$(FULLVER) $@'</span>.  The linker needs that link to link
against the real file.  The reason you put the major version in
DT_SONAME and not the real file with the minor version is because you
want the executable to use new minor versions.  Suppose there was a
minor version release with just some bug fixes in the implementation
(but the interface remains the same).
</p>
<pre>
libfoo.so     --> libfoo.so.3.1
libfoo.so.2   --> libfoo.so.2.6
libfoo.so.3   --> libfoo.so.3.1
libfoo.so.2.4
libfoo.so.2.6
libfoo.so.3.1
</pre>
<p>
So, with the addition of version 2.6, no code had to change.  You just
update the links so that libfoo.so.2 now points to libfoo.so.2.6.  You
can deal with updating library links using ldconfig.  And everyone is
still happy!  (Incidentally, I hope you can see why it's so important
to get the interface for a library -- or indeed any code -- right the
first time through.  Little bugs in the implementation can usually be
fixed later.)</p>

<hr />
<p>
Well, call me Ishmael, but this little story still isn't finished.  There
is another way you can "link" to libraries.  Instead of having the
linker and loader doing things for you, you can do it all yourself
from within the code.  You use the dlfcn.h header with the libdl
library.  All you have to do is call dlopen with the name and path of
the library you want to use.  Then pass dlsym the symbol name of the
symbol you wish to use.  It will look for the symbol in the library
and return you a reference to it.  Then you can use it just as you
would with normal code.
</p><p>
You just have to keep in mind that you no longer want to link against
the library.  You don't care what's in DT_SONAME anymore.  You are
taking over the loader's job.
</p>
<pre class="code">
$(foo).so: $(foo).c
	$(CC) $&lt; $(FLAGS) -fPIC -shared -o $@

$(foo): $(foo).so $(foo).c
	$(CC) $(FLAGS) -DFOO_SO=\"$(PWD)/$&lt;\" $@.c -o $@ -ldl
</pre>
<p>
The first dependency says foo.so will depend on foo.c.  Last time, I
built the object file separately and then made an so out of it.  This
time, I did it all in one go since there's only one object file to put
into the so anyway.  When you do it this way, you also need to give
gcc the -shared option.  Next build foo just like before but this time
link in libdl (-ldl) which is a shared object for the dl code.  (Note
this has nothing to do with our shared library.  We just need that
code.)  There is no need to specify a library search path to the
linker, or the library name, or an soname.  The only other parameter
of interest is -DFOO_SO=.  The -D option lets you predefine macros.
What I've done here is create a macro, FOO_SO, that's a string with
the name of the current directory followed by the file, foo.so.  The
$&lt; variable is the first dependency on the line above ($(foo).so ==>
foo.so).
</p><p>
This is great.  You now have the ability to load arbitrary shared
objects (code or data) at runtime.  That's really cool (and probably a
bit dangerous -- be careful).  Take a minute or two to think what you
can do with this type of flexible design.  So, that's about it.  The
links below have additional information.</p>

<hr />

<p>
<span class="bold">*</span> You may find it useful to know that you can search through a man
page by typing a slash, then the search term, then return.  Press 'n'
to search again.  When looking for a specific flag, say -l,  in a long man file,
try searching for '-l ' first.  That way you won't get -length or -line or -label.
</p><p>
<span class="bold">+</span> Usually version numbers come in the form Major.Minor.Release.  Take
3.2.22 as an example.  The 3 says it's the third major version.  The 2
was a relatively small change.  The last number is just for very minor
modifications, like a bug fix.  Usually the minor number will be even
for public releases.  The odd versions are used for development and
testing.
