<p>
I was reading <a
href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/polymorphism-fails.html">this
blog</a>.  And the monster problem caught my attention.  I decided to
take a stab at solving it.  Actually, my solution was immediately
obvious to me.  I'll share it with you.  Incidentally, the author of
the blog is very prolific.  You'll learn a lot from reading his
entries.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that in order to extend object oriented code without
having access to the code, you need to do some ugly coding.  Take a
look at the OpinionatedELF example.  He suggests runtime typing every
other object to determine how the Elf will react to the other
monsters.  Obviously you don't want to do this because you have to add
a new line and recompile each time a new monster is added.
</p>

<p>
My solution was to instead add a name method to each monster.  In fact
in Python, thanks to powerful introspection, this can be done by
adding the name method to the base class only.  Thus no monsters need
to be touched.  Now all the Opinionated Elf has to do is ask the
monster who he is by invoking his name method.  This is better than
using the runtime typing because it removes the dependence, in some
sense, from the language.  One monster is "talking" to the other
instead of the monster relying on the language or the interpreter for
the answer.  The example is below.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flkf">class</span> <span class="fltf">monster</span>:
    <span class="flkf">def</span> <span class="flfnf">name</span>(<span class="py-pseudo-keyword-face">self</span>):
        s = <span class="py-builtins-face">str</span>(<span class="py-pseudo-keyword-face">self</span>.name)
        <span class="flkf">return</span> s[14:s.find("<span class="flsf">.name</span>")]

<span class="flkf">class</span> <span class="fltf">orc</span>(monster):
    <span class="flkf">pass</span>

<span class="flkf">class</span> <span class="fltf">elf</span>(monster):
    <span class="flkf">pass</span>

<span class="flkf">class</span> <span class="fltf">opinionated_elf</span>:
    __likes = {"<span class="flsf">orc</span>": <span class="py-pseudo-keyword-face">False</span>,
               "<span class="flsf">elf</span>": <span class="py-pseudo-keyword-face">True</span>}
    <span class="flkf">def</span> <span class="flfnf">do_i_like</span>(<span class="py-pseudo-keyword-face">self</span>,monster):
        <span class="flkf">return</span> <span class="py-pseudo-keyword-face">self</span>.__likes[monster.name()]
    
<span class="flkf">print</span> opinionated_elf().do_i_like(orc())
<span class="flkf">print</span> opinionated_elf().do_i_like(elf())
</pre>

<p>
Notice that when you do it this way the Opinionated Elf can be
updated without recompiling any code.  The hash table of likes could
be read from a file.  It could be updated in real-time over the
network.  The solution is on a slightly higher level of abstraction
using inter-object communication instead of object-interpreter
communication.
</p>

<p>
I e-mailed the author, and he told me I had an "eminently reasonable
solution", but that I went outside the class model.  I didn't quite
get that last part.  It seems to me that it's still polymorphic given
that each monster will respond with its own name.  It's just that I've
moved the decision into the Elf, where it should be.  I believe the
idea of message passing was one of the original ideas behind objects.
But in any case, it works with virtually no special code.  And it's
completely extensible.
