<h1 class="topofpage">External Firewire Drive</h1>

<p>
Backups are good.  That's why I bought myself an 80GB external drive
to keep my data safe.  I decided to take my friend's advice and check
out customer feedback on various drives.  So I surfed on over to <a
href="www.newegg.com">newegg</a> and took a look at some external
drives.  I was hoping to get one with both a usb and firewire
interface, but they were more exensive, and there were fewer choices.
The Fantom Drive got excellent ratings; so, I went with it.  
</p>

<p>
When it arrived, I had an immediate dissapointment.   I had read that
firewire provides its own power.  But the drive came with an
external power adaptor and wouldn't turn on without it.  I plugged in
the drive and turned it on.  It was very quiet at least.  I tried to
run fdisk on the corresponding device, but it failed complaining about
not being able to read the partition table along with other errors.
</p>

<p>
After posting to the linux1394-users list, someone had me patch my
kernel from <a href="">here</a>.  Unfortunately, that didn't help.  He
then had me generate some debug output.  To do this compile the
following into the kernel.  Also, disable your log files so your
internal hard disk is not being used.
</p>
<pre>
--&gt; Device Drivers
    --&gt; SCSI Device Support
        --&gt; SCSI Logging Facility
</pre>

<p>
Eventually I removed the pci card with the firewire ports and
transfered it to a windows box.  In linux, I could at least see that
there was an 80GB hard drive there.  In windows XP, it didn't work at
all.  At one point it told me there may be a problem with the device.
I later tried it on a mac without my pci card and it worked just fine.
So the pci card I was using was suspect now.  I had read that
the via controllers do have some known problems with certain devices.
But I was told that linux has a simple work around and that this was
probably not the problem.
</p>

<p>
I finally got around to calling tech support.  The first thing they
told me was that firewire pci card has a connection for more power.
This seemed a bit strange.  The hard disk has an external power
adaptor, gets power over the pci bus, and requires another internal
power adaptor.  I bought an adaptor from the standard four pin power
supply in the case to the smaller four pins on the pci card.  It's the
exact same adaptor as for a floppy drive.  But I had to file a little
plastic tab off the back to get it fit over the pins.  (I noticed when
 I returned that this connection actually came with my power supply.  Oops.)
The adaptor didn't help at all.
</p>

<p>
At this point I tried it on another windows machine (again with the
same pci card).  Windows seemed to recognize a device.  But that was
about as far as it got.  There were some funny error codes that even
the tech support guy didn't recognize.
</p>

<p>
At this point I finally went out and got another pci card.  I noticed
that one of the more expensive cards had the full size power connector
on it.  It didn't require an adaptor.  The card I bought did need the
adaptor though.  This one did not have any via chips on it.  I tried
it in the windows machine and it worked.  When I later tried it on my
linux box, I removed the power adaptor, and it still worked (as I
suspected).
</p>

<p>
Apparently, either the via firewire chip does not work, or there is a
problem with the electronics on the pci card, or it has some kind of
conflict with this hard drive.  For your reference, the pci card I have
has four external usb ports and one internal.  There are two external
firewire ports and one internal.  There are two chips on the card.
One is for usb -- VT6212.  The other is for firewire -- VT6306. 
</p>

<p>
The drive came formated as FAT32.  I repartioned using fdisk.  I
created a standard 30GB linux partion for backing up my internal raid
drive and a 50GB one for anything else.  Then I ran <span
class="bold">mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdf1</span> to create the file system.
And then <spand class="bold">mount /dev/sdf1 /dev/fire</span>.  That's
it.  I use flexbackup to make my backups.
