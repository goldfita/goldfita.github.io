<h1 class="topofpage">A Web Interface to the Asterisk Manager</h1>

<h4 class="nounderline">The Asterisk Manager Interface</h4>

<p>
If you were going to develop an extremely popular telephony server,
what features might you include?  It would need to be easily
extensible.  Otherwise, how would someone unfamiliar with the code base
truly be able to customize it?*  This is accomplished at two different
levels.  There are the asterisk modules for C hackers with some
knowledge of internals.  And there is the Asterisk Gateway Interface
(AGI) for those with little or no understanding of the code.
</p>

<p>
But you would also want a way to control the server and analyze the
traffic.  That's the Asterisk Manager's job.  So next you might wonder,
how can it made as flexible as possible?  As a first attempt, you
might build a module that can interact directly with standard input
and monitor the internal state of the server.  One problem is this
forces your precious users to interface with the server directly at
the console from where Asterisk was started.
</p>

<p>
You might decouple the manager from the start console by using either
IPC or sockets.  Let's use sockets because this will let us connect to
asterisk from a remote machine.  In fact, it will let us connect from
any machine on just about any modern operating system and even from
embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
The interface now has two parts.  It will have a client that interacts
directly with the user (the User Interface) and a protocol that sits
on top of TCP.  Since the latter portion is hidden from the user it
seems like a good idea to send numeric codes that represent the
actions.  However, consider that there is really not much benefit to this.
In this scenario, it's unlikely that a little extra bandwidth and
processing power are going to harm anything.  Sending the commands
as the same text the user sees will be easier to program.  There
is no need to convert from text to numbers, you don't have to remember
special codes when programming, and there is just less room for
mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Also consider what happens when something goes wrong.  Those codes
will be the debug output.  Someone might find them by intercepting
Internet traffic.  They might get dumped into a log file or spit out
on the console.  They could even end up in a core file.  It would be
very difficult to try and diagnose the problem.  On the other
hand, if you sent plain text, the problem might be immediately
obvious.  Which of the following would you prefer to see?
</p>

<pre>
       Correct                 Error
Text   Action: Login           Action: Logij
Code   ^#                      ^(
</pre>

<p>
So we've decided that our protocol will be a relatively simple plain
text scheme over TCP.
</p>

<p><span class="bold">*</span>You might try adding in a million features and customizations, but
this design strategy can only take you so far.  There will always be
crazy applications the end user wishes to try which you didn't
consider.  A built-in language is always more flexible than a
customization file to control a rich set of features.  Compare EMACS
and MS Word.  However, you should remember who your customers are.
