<h4 class="nounderline">Buffering</h4>

<p>
The next task was to decide how to store the incoming responses.  I
decided to store them in a circular buffer with no additional levels
of abstraction.  This turned out to be extremely difficult to
implement.  I later considered a resizeable, circular list.  See
<a href="appendixa.html">Appendix A</a> for a comparison.
</p>

<pre>
A)
message 1\r\nmessage 2\r\nmessa^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^                         ^    ^
|end            start,pend|    |pstart

B)
message 1\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^messa^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^            ^            ^    ^
|end         |start       |pend|pstart

C)
message 1\r\nmessa^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^            ^    ^-------pstart
|end         |start,pend

D)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^messa^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
             ^    ^-------pstart
             |end,start,pend

E)
essage5\r\n^^message 3\r\nmessage 4\r\nm
           ^ ^------------end
           |start,pstart,pend
</pre>

<p>
There are four pointers into the buffer: end, start, pend, and
pstart.  End points to the oldest character in the buffer, which is the
start of the oldest message.  Start points to the character just after
the last completed message in the buffer.  The 'p' in pend refers to
the partial, as in partial message.  It points to the oldest character
of the partial message (if there is one).  Pstart points to the
character just after the start of the partial message.  Normally, this
character is garbage (represented by ^) except in the case where the
buffer is full.
</p>

<p>
Case A shows the buffer when two full messages and a partial message
have been read.  In case B, the newest message has been read (removed)
from the buffer by the other thread.  The interface will allow you to
peek at any message but only remove the oldest message or the newest
completed message.  At this point, start and pend no longer point to
the same character.  This tells the reader thread that it has to copy
the partial message back to start and correct pend and pstart.  This
is shown in case C.  Case D demonstrates the first message being
read.  This case is very simple; end is moved up to the next message.
Case E demonstrates the completion of message 3 being read, followed
by two more messages.  Notice that since this is a circular buffer,
message 5 wraps around.  If another message were read (or even a
partial one) before message 3 or message 5 were remove, end would have
to be moved up, meaning at least message 3 would be lost (if not more
messages).  However, we will hope that the buffer is large enough and
that it's rare for more than two or three messages to be buffered.
</p>

<p>
One limitation of this design is that it requires the buffer size to
be a power of two.  Although it is possible to implement it with an
arbitrary buffer size, this would require many, many conditional
statements, making the code just about impossible to understand (or
just inefficient).  There is one nice advantage to this method though.
It's almost impossible to have buffer overflow because the indices
wrap around.
