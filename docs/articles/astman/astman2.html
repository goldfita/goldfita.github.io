<h4 class="nounderline">The Protocol</h4>

<p>
The AMI server and client communicate via packets which are made up of
single line commands.  Every command is made up of a key/value pair as
below.
</p>

<p>
Action: Ping\r\n
</p>

<p>
Every line is terminated by carriage return and line feed.  In the
case of the ping command, the command is the packet except for the
terminating new line.  An example of a complete packet with four
commands is below.
</p>

<pre>
Action: Login\r\n
Username: todd\r\n
Secret: todd\r\n
Event: off\r\n
\r\n
</pre>

<p>
The first three commands are mandatory and will get you logged in
assuming the manager.conf file is setup correctly.  The event command
tells Asterisk not to send back event responses when off is specified
(although I could not get it to work with login).  The final '\r\n'
terminates the packet.  You can also turn off events using an event
command.  (However, once it's off, on doesn't seem to work.)
</p>

<pre>
Action: Events\r\n
Eventmask: off\r\n
\r\n
</pre>

<p>
Once a packet is sent, the response can come back at any time and I
belive it can also come back in any order.  As an experiment, I pasted
the following into a telnet session.
</p>

<pre>
telnet localhost 5038

Action: Ping
ActionID: A

Action: Ping
ActionID: B

Action: Ping
ActionID: C
</pre>

<p>
This is three packets, each consisting of two commands, sent all at
once.  The ActionID key tells Asterisk that you want it to send back
the value that follows (the id) as a tag for the command.  That way,
you know which responses are associated with the commands that were
sent.  In this case, I got back the following.  The responses are in
order, but I don't believe this is guaranteed.  I could take a look at
the source code and see if the responses would, in fact, come back in the
same order.  However, that doesn't mean the implementation won't
change in the future.  So I will assume the most general case: packets
can come back in any order.
</p>

<pre>
Response: Pong
ActionID: A

Response: Pong
ActionID: B

Response: Pong
ActionID: C
</pre>

<p>
Some commands are not truly complete after only one packet is sent.
In the following scenario, I send a packet to monitor a channel.  A
response is sent back that says the channel is being monitored -- a
file is being recorded.  Then I send a ping command.  Last I request
that the channel stop being monitored.  Some commands will send back a
list of packets, all with the same id.    Events will be sent from
Asterisk periodically without any commands from the client at all.  As I
mentioned, these can be disabled.
</p>

<pre>
ACTION: Monitor
Channel: SIP/555-bfcc
File: channelsavefile
Mix: 1

Response: Success
Message: Started monitoring channel

Action: Ping

Response: Pong

Action: StopMonitor
Channel: SIP/555-bfcc

Response: Success
Message: Stopped monitoring channel
</pre>

<p>
Writing a client for this protocol is a bit tricky.  It must satisfy
the following requirements.
</p>

<ul>
<li>detect start/end of packets</li>
<li>handle concurrency</li>
<li>handle out-of-order responses</li>
<li>allow for association of commands and responses</li>
<li>handle unexpected responses</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because I would like to make the interface web accessible, the interface should
not take too long to timeout, or worse, hang permanently, when
something goes wrong.  Given these constraints, I decided to have two
threads.  One thread will be responsible for reading responses into
a buffer.  The other thread will write commands and read completed
and processed responses from the input buffer.  This is much more
difficult to code than a single-threaded, blocking design, but it
allows me to separate reading and parsing of data from the interface.
More importantly, it lets me guarantee that the interface thread will
never hang, even if the reader thread does.
