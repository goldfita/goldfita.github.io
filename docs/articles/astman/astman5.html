<h4 class="nounderline">Implementation Details</h4>

<p>
I'm not going to cover every line of code.  But I want to point out a
few things.  First notice that I often prefix private functions,
functions that are not accessible as part of the library, with two
underscores.  To be consistent, I should have done this with every
private function (but this was a learning project for me too).
</p>

<p>
If you look real hard, you'll probably see some gotos.  I'm not
writing spaghetti code.  I always use them in the same way to escape
from the function when something goes wrong.
</p>

<p>
Take a look at ast_strip_response2.  First notice that it's invoked as
a one liner from ast_strip_response.  You should see a lot of these
short front-end functions, and I'll explain them in a moment.  Next
notice how the code chooses between stripping __headers and your custom
headers.  Originally I wrote this so you had to specify an array of
pointers and an array length.  But using the NULL terminator simplifies the
interface and makes changes easier.  It also allowed me to simplify
the implementation and add in additional functionality all at once.
</p>

<p>
The reason for all those front-end functions is to reduce duplicate
code.  Frequently, two or more functions, like those ending in _r and
_f, will do nearly the same thing.  Instead of writing two versions of
the same function, I create a back-end function that has most of the
logic and then invoke that function in a different way from the
front-end function.  The cost of this is an extra function call (which
hopefully isn't much).  Another reason for those functions is
threading.  Sometimes I need to lock a mutex inside a function.  But
then I need to call that function from another function, and I need to
lock a mutex there also.  You can't do this (think about why).  One
solution is to remove the mutex from the inner function.  But this
would require whoever is using the API to lock a mutex around the
function.  This is just asking for trouble.  Instead, create another
back-end function.  Then the inner function now locks a mutex, calls
the new function, and unlocks the mutex.  Structuring your source
so that you can reduce duplicate code while keeping the interface
simple requires you to be thinking at multiple levels of abstraction
simultaneously.
