<p>
To begin a session, you must first connect to the manager.  You can do
that with the ast_connect statement below.  Almost every function returns an
integer error code.  The codes can be found in the header file.
AST_SUCCESS means the action succeeded.  Any other code is a failure.
You can get a string specifying the error by passing the code to
ast_error.  It would have been just as efficient to return a pointer
to the error message.  However, this makes error comparison a little
more straightforward in the source code.

<p>
The ast_connection structure is allocated inside the connection
function.  This object is always passed first to each function.  You
can think of this as the connection object, and the functions that accept it as
an argument are its member functions.  The connection object is opaque
to you (the user).  Although there is a definition of it in the header
file, there is no reason you should need to access any of its
members.  There are accessor/mutators for anything you might need to
do.  The connection can be freed with ast_close.
</p>

<p>
The second parameter is optional.  You can pass NULL, and the
connection function will use the default values.  The mem member is
the buffer size (power of 2).  Host and port refer to the AMI machine
name and port.  The callback function, if non-NULL,  will be invoked
after every read.  This doesn't mean after every message; so, you have
to check yourself.  You might use the callback for an event driven
application, such as a GUI manager.
</p>

<p>
The callback mechanism isn't really much help for a web application.
The driving force is the browser, not the Asterisk server.  For an
application like this, we either need to wait for responses, or poll
for them periodically.  Since I don't want to risk the browser hanging
while waiting for the Asterisk server to send back a response, I made
a compromise.  The read doesn't block, but it will still wait a
certain amount of time before giving up waiting for a response.  You can set the number of
attempts with the tries member.  In between each read attempt, it will
sleep for sleep_milli milliseconds.  With this design, you can
effectively wait for as long or as short as you like.  The
last connect_params member is wait_for_resp.  By setting this to
AST_NOSEARCH, requests will return immediately without waiting at
all.  If it's AST_SEARCHFORWARD, requests will wait for responses according to tries
and sleep_milli.  The buffer will be searched starting from the oldest
messages.  If it's AST_SEARCHREVERSE, the buffer is searched starting
from the newest messages (towards the oldest or the start of the
buffer).
</p>

<p>
After each function, you should check the error code.  The next thing
you need to do is log in.  The following statement passes the
connection object, which is fully initialized at this point (and a
reader thread is running in the background).  The next two parameters
are the username and password.
</p>

<pre class="code">
code = ast_login(conn,"todd","todd");
</pre>

<p> This is actually a macro which can be found in ast_man.h.  All the
commands are, in fact, macros which invoke a variadic parameter list
function, ast_call.  This makes the library easy to extend.  All you
would need to do is define a new macro.  The reason this is possible
is because I have made the underlying implementation as simplistic as
possible.  The code makes few assumptions about what you might want
it to do.  The request, forwards the command to Asterisk and does
little more.  Reading the request from the buffer does essentially no
postprocessing on the message.  There are some support functions, such
as ast_stripresponse, which will operate on the response message.
However, you need to call this extra function if you wish to use it.
This is a design tradeoff.  By making the basic functionality as simple as
possible, the code is faster and doesn't do anything you don't need it
to do.  But if you need the extra support code, you have to do all the
work yourself (which means more code and time).  
</p>


<p>
As you peruse the list of functions that comprise the interface,
you'll see peek and get.  Peek means that the message will be copied
into another buffer which you can then read by calling
ast_get_response.  Get will do the same thing, but it will also remove
the message from the read buffer.  The only other difference is that you can
peek at any message but only get the first or last message.  You will
also see _r and _f.  If you see _r, that means the search starts from
the end of the buffer (reverse).  The _f means it starts from the
front.  Generally, it's faster to read from the front of the buffer
because there are no partial messages to skip over (and no memory to
copy).  When I first designed the interface, I only allowed for
reading from the end of the buffer where the messages are written to.
But I later discovered that some requests can have multiple
responses.  Since the responses can be returned at any time, there is
no way to preserve response order when reading from the end.  But you
can preserve order if you always read from the front.  So, I added the
_f functions.  I decided to keep the _r functions.  Conceivably
they're still useful.  However, you can choose to build the library
without them.
</p>

<p>
Any function that has by_id as part of its name will search for a
message by the id you specify.  Every request/response pair automatically has an id
associated with it.  You can get the id of the last response by
calling ast_get_last_id.</p>

<p>
If you see wait in the name, it means the function will block
according to the members of connect_params.  Otherwise, it will check
the buffer once immediately and then return.  The functions
ast_overrun, ast_success, and ast_connected tell you whether the
buffer has been overrun, if the last command succeeded, and if you are
connected to an Asterisk server, respectively.
</p>

<p>
The remaining function is ast_strip_response.  This will move the
'ActionID: #' and Response: Success' lines in the results buffer to
just after the NULL character.  The function will return a pointer to
these lines, in case you still need them.  Ast_strip_response2 does
the same thing, but it lets you specify which lines you wish to
remove from the response.  The headers parameter is an array of
pointers to strings, terminated by a NULL pointer.  Any action name
you place in here will be cut from the response message and moved to
the end of the string.  See the  diagram below.  As mentioned before,
these are support functions.  You may not need them, but they're there
to help.
</p>

<pre>
Response: Success\r\nAction: Ping\r\nActionID: 3\r\n\r\n\0

becomes

Action: Ping\r\n\r\n\0Response: Success\r\nActionID: 3\r\n\0
                      ^---return pointer
</pre>

<p>
One thing to notice about the interface is that most of the functions
take only one or two parameters (the first is always ast_connection).
Wherever possible, I have tried to remove parameter options to keep the
parameter lists short.  That keeps the code short and makes the
interface easy to understand.  In some cases, where specifying options was necessary,
I added the options to connect_params.  This way they can be set once
at the beginning.  If absolutely necessary, they can be changed by
operating on the ast_connection structure.
