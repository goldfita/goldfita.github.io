<h1 class="topofpage">JPEG Blocking</h1>


<p>
I previously talked about <a
href="../compressarticle/audiocodecs.html">audio compression</a>.  But I
have also worked with image compression.  Surprise!  My brief
experience with this was in a <a
href="../../projects/dct_midterm.doc">class</a>.
</p>

<p>
All compression is fundamentally the same.  Allocate the least bits to
the most frequently represented symbols.  If all symbols are equally represented,
then the signal is at maximum uncertainty or entropy, which is almost
the <a
href="http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/pitfalls.html#confusing_H_with_S">same
thing</a>.  In this case, your signal would be white noise, and it
can't be compressed.
</p>

<p>
One technique in image compression is to break the image up into 8x8
blocks, apply the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">DCT</a>, quantize, and compress.  This is essentially how jpeg
compression works.  One reason the DCT is chosen as the transform is
that it has good energy compaction properties.  Most of the energy in
the signal will be concentrated into the first few coefficients.  And
the human eye is supposed to be somewhat insensitive to the higher
frequencies.  Thus you can quantize them quite heavily.  However,
there may be other <a href="http://www.dsprelated.com/showmessage/34432/1.php">reasons</a> for using the DCT as well.
</p>

<p>
An unfortunate side effect of breaking the image up into 8x8 blocks is
that the blocking is visible in the decompressed image.  In a highly
compressed image, it is very noticeable.  There are various techniques
for decreasing the blocking effect.  They range from very simple
filtering and averaging to more complex ideas such as projection onto
convex sets.  (If you have the time to learn optimization theory,
then I say go for it.)
</p>

<p>
I had the idea that averaging spatial domain, decompressed images, where
the blocking was shifted, might lead to better results.  But this
requires saving multiple copies of the compressed image, which
isn't realistic.  After doing some research, I found a <a
href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~aria/mcl/post/">similar idea</a> that
doesn't require saving multiple compressed images.  Not
realizing this is a post-processing only technique (most are), I
implemented this as averaging in the DCT domain.
</p>

<p>
That's OK.  I still got some interesting results.  The first image
below is the decompressed image without any additional processing.  Only
the DCT and quantization steps were performed.  The second one is the
same except eight extra copies of the image were averaged in the DCT
domain.  The extra copies were shifted at most one pixel horizontally,
vertically, or both.  And they were weight less than the main copy.
</p>

<a href="pre1_clown60.png">clown2</a><br />
<a href="pre3_clown60.png">clown3</a>
</p>

<p>
There is a hint of blur in the decompressed image due to the shifting
and averaging.  Although the blocking doesn't appear any different
on the clown between the first and second images, there seems to be
less blocking around the numbers and letters (by my inspection).
</p>

<p>
In the last image, 48 extra weighted images were averaged.  The blur
at this point is very bad.  And it appears to have actually increased
blocking of the hair.
</p>

<p>
What is interesting about trying to deblock an image this way is that
it's a preprocessing step.  No post-processing is required.  This is
desirable if possible because an image usually only needs to be
compressed once, but it may be decompressed frequently.  Due to the
high complexity of some post-processing algorithms, frequent
decompression may be undesirable.
</p>

<p>
Some more work remains to be done.  I didn't experiment much with the
weights.  I also quantized twice -- after the DCT and after
averaging.  You might get better results by quantizing only at the
end.  It would also be useful to compare the second image to a
post-processed, low pass filtered image.  I couldn't do this without
writing my own conv2 for octave.

<h4 class="nounderline">Getting Octave</h4>

<p>
You will need to install <a href="http://www.octave.org">octave</a>.
Since the Unix culture believes strongly in code reuse, you will also
need <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a> and <a
href="http://www.imagemagick.org">imagemagick</a>.  Take care of the
first two with <span class="bold">emerge octave</span> and the last
with <span class="bold">emerge imagemagick</span>.  If you don't have
Gentoo, well, have fun!
</p>

<p>
You will also nee <a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/octave/octave-forge/main/signal/dct.m?rev=HEAD"></a>,
<a
href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/octave/octave-forge/main/signal/idct.m?rev=HEAD"></a>,
and <a
href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ahyvarin/kurssi/imread.m"></a>.
Copy the first two into /usr/share/octave/2.1.69/m/signal and the last
into /usr/shae/octave/2.1.69/m/image.  Your directories might be a bit
different.
</p>

<p>
You will also need matlab or octave mode for emacs.  I suggest using
<a
href="http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/16-720/extras/matlab_in_emacs/">matlab
mode</a>; it's much more complete.  The only trouble is that octave
lets you use '#' and '"' for comments and strings respectively. But
these are invalid in matlab syntax, and it will confuse matlab mode.
So you might want to avoid them, or change them to '%' and '''.
