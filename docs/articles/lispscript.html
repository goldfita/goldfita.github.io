<h1 class="topofpage">Lisp Browser</h1>

<p>
An old idea I <a href="embedlisp.html">posted</a> was brought back
from the grave in my mind when I read this <a
href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/the-emacs-problem.html">blog
entry</a>.  I was specifically interested in the Lisp-log-message
idea.
</p>

<p>
Not too long ago I had this idea that browsers should just be
specialized Lisp interpreters.  EMACS has a web browser called W3.
But I've seen it, and it's not so good.  I think a specialized browser
application would be far more successful.
</p>

<p>
I've often found myself wondering if maybe GET/POST isn't the way to
go.  Think about all the technologies that work over HTTP.  Javascript
is embedded into HTML comments.  SOAP is over HTTP.  Pretty much
everything browser related is in some way over HTTP.  But GET and POST
an HTML/XML, so far as I can tell, were really meant for static or
near static content.  That's why we keep coming up with things like
Javascript, SOAP, and AJAX.  It's a way to circumvent the limitations
of HTTP and HTML.
</p>

<p>
Maybe we just need something different.  Maybe instead of sending
static pages with mini-embedded languages, we should just send the
whole program... as a Lisp script.  If the browser itself were just a
Lisp interpreter, than interpreting the incoming script should be
trivial.  Also notice how much of a load this would take off servers.
They would no longer need to execute much business logic.  Instead,
the server would be responsible for extracting information from the
database, performing the minimum number of calculations needed on the
server side, and then send the Lisp (data, code and all) right over to
the client.
</p>

<p>
How exactly this would work, I have no idea.  Unfortunately it's far
more complicated than my simplified idea here.  There would still have
to be some kind of standard way of representing the data in the way that
HTML and CSS work.  But instead of embedding code into the static data
as with HTML and Javascript, the data would be in structures in the
Lisp code.  If the client needed something from the server, the call
would be made right from the Lisp as if it were just a normal
application executing on your desktop.  You might have the rest of
the program on the server.  So a client/server connection would be
nothing more than invoking a (remote) function.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes I wonder if Lisp interpreters shouldn't be like DSPs.  We
could put a little embedded Lisp interpreter in everything.  You
wouldn't even need know that they were there.  But the engineers will
know, and they'll make heavy use of them.
