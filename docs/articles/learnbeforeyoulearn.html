<p>
My friend likes to say you need to eat before you eat.  By this he
means you should snack before you go out to eat or you'll order too
much food.  It's similar to the concept of not going grocery shopping
on an empty stomach.
</p>

<p>
I have my own saying: learn before you learn.  By this, I mean you
should try to really understand a new (to you) technology or concept
before you use it on a real project.  It's similar to building a
prototype of a software project.  You're trying to understand as much
as you can about the design as quickly as you can before you do it for
real.  The goal is to make all the mistakes up front, so you can get
it right on the real project.
</p>

<p>
I did this when I was working on my master's thesis.  Taking complex
algorithms from matlab and migrating them onto a real-time DSP is no
simple task.  I chose a small learning project to get myself warmed
up.  The previous year I had worked on a <a href="../projects/formants/formant.html">formant tracking project</a>
which I was never able to get working quite right.  Part of the
problem was that it was just too complex to try implementing right on
the DSP.
</p>

<p>
I decided to modify the algorithm.  The original used Levinson-Durbin
recursion with a Muller's root finding method.  Unfortunately it
wasn't implemented quite right and the root finding method was too
slow.  I decided to change it to approximate the formants with an LMS
and an iterative Newton's method.  (My final results weren't very
good, but it was working as far as I could tell.)  I first got it
working in matlab.  Then I implemented it in C and tested it in the
emulator.  This was a definite improvement over how I had tried to do
it the first time.  Finally I migrated that code to the DSP.  It took
a while, but I was able to get it working.
</p>

<p>
This process of matlab -> emulation -> DSP was far more effective than
just trying a few matlab experiments and then going right to the DSP.
So I already learned a useful thing or two.  And it's good I did
because my master's project was 10 to 100 times more difficult.  From
what I learned on this project, I was able to refine the process to
matlab -&gt; mex file -&gt; emulation -&gt; DSP.  I may never have completed my
work if it hadn't been for some of the initial mistakes I made.  Once
you start doing things the wrong way on a project, it's hard to get
yourself to backup and fix the process and the problems.  But it's easy to start out
doing it correctly on a fresh project.  You just have to have made the
mistakes already.
</p>

<p>
Well now I have done a small project and a big one.  I have learned
before I learned before I learned.  My new process now looks like
matlab -&gt; mex file -&gt; emulation -&gt; <a href="regressiontests.html">regression
tests</a> -&gt; DSP.  I have come a long way from my initial
process (basically none).  The learn-before-you-learn technique can
push you a little ways up that hill before you start working on
something real.  It will help you uncover problems before they
actually matter.
