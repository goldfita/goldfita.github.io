I proably should have worded that better.  And I don't recommend
saying anything that might offend an entire small company.  There were
also a few other e-mails that were probably a little to aggressive.





*Apparently zero-defect software doesn't mean <a
href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.220229.28">no
bugs</a>.  I don't quite understand what it means.  This was the first
time I had heard of such a thing, and frankly I think it smacks of
arrogance.  It's also irresponsible.  If you didn't know anything
about software, and someone told you that you were getting zero-defect
software, what would you think?  However, I still applaud the effort to achieve such a
goal.  I can't stress enough how difficult this is.  The disipline and
maturity involved is attained by few.

+Be careful what you say by e-mail.  I've read that as much as half
(or more) of all e-mail is misinterpreted by the receiving end.
Because your expression and emotion can't be read, the reader is
relying only on the words and <span class="italics">his</span>
emotional state.

My Amazon Experience

Out of the blue I got an e-mail from a lady (call her S) who asked if I
wanted to interview with Amazon.  I told S I had no interest in going
to Seattle.  For the rest of the day I kept looking back at her e-mail
with its enthusiastic comments about me.  Well, I've already turned
down Bloomberg and Redhat for an interview.  I figured the stupidity
has to stop.  So I e-mailed S back and basically said sure, why not.

At this point, I wasn't aware that Amazon ranks up there with
Microsoft and Google in terms of quality of work, smart people, and
good pay.  I had actually once sent a resume to Google after finding a
job ad in CUJ.  It was rejected.  Never have I applied to work at
Microsoft.  (I've gotten myself in trouble for lack of ambition in the
past.)  I probably should have been
flattered that Amazon was coming to me for an interview, but  I just
wasn't aware of their reputation.  I wonder if the fact that I pretty
much blew them off at first came off as confidence or stupidity.

Now I still really didn't understand why S was interested in me.  I
was, after all, looking for a DSP job.  She cited my object oriented
design, interesting projects, strong academics, and my music
background*.  Perhaps they're just trying to interview as many smart
appearing candidates as possible.  She was persistent even through my lack of
enthusiasm.  And I bluntly told her I still wasn't sure about the
Seattle thing.

So I went to the interview, nervous as usual but no idea what I was
in for.  The first tip off that something was up came when the guy
sitting near me said he used to work at Microsoft.  It was becomming
apparent that this was not going to be an easy interview.  To make
matters worse, I wasn't terribly motivated, I've never had a technical
CS interview, I haven't done much data
structures type stuff in five years, and my school didn't really cover
it very well.  I actually learned most of what I know on my own in
high school, which was about nine years ago.  And some people really,
really <a href="http://blog.mattgoyer.com/technical-interview-at-amazon-sde-and-microsoft-program-manager">prepare</a> for these things.  Check <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/google-secret-weapon.html">this
one</a> out too.

The first guy I interviewed with was obviously extremely intelligent
and motivated.  In fact, he told me before Amazon, he had been working
90 hours a week on Wall Street.  After that interview, I got the
feeling they had already made their decision about me.  I had one
more interview with another very intelligent software engineer, which also
didn't go too well.  In fact, my implementation of <a href="reverse.html">list reversal</a> was
so awkward, it took him a while to even grasp it.  After that they let
me go.  I'm pretty sure I was supposed to interview with several more
people, but it looked like they had already made a decision.

*I assume she was speaking of MusicRebellion.
