<a name="intro"></a>
<p>
So you've finally gotten that 4 year (or 6 year or 10 year) degree.
Employers are banging down your door with $70000 offers to work on the
coolest projects.  Ha! Right.  Maybe that's how it worked during the
bubble but not anymore.  I've had friends who couldn't find work for
months.  Heck, some of my friends still can't find work.
</p>

<p>
What are you going to do?  You're not going to mope around the house
all day.  And you're not going to take a crap job leading nowhere
either.  Fortunately for you, I've done all the research.  I'm going
to tell you exactly what you need to do to find work.  From the time I
left school until the time I got an offer was about three months.  In
that time I have gotten phone calls and e-mails from many companies,
including Bloomberg (five times and counting) and <a
href="#amazon">Amazon</a>.  I am still being contacted a few
times each month.  To find out how, read on.
</p>

<hr />

<a name="webpage"></a>
<p>I was once hanging out with some roommates and their friends, when
someone mentioned how much he loves interviewing.  I absolutely hate
interviews.  These are the people I'm competing with.  These are the
people you're competing with.  Many employers try to be objective.
But that's really not possible.  They're going to favor the outgoing,
confident candidates over you and me (unless they have something
against extroverts).  You need to reclaim that lost ground.  You're
the one with the real talent, and you know it.
</p>

<p>
The very first thing you're going to do is put up a web page.  No, not
of your dog and family and the ice cream social last week.  Post your
work.  It will be months, at least, before you find something.
Building a professional web site is a full time job.  You need to
start advertising yourself now.  It's a lot of work, but think of the
advantages.  That site will be up and searchable on the web 24/7.
Once you get it up there, it will be your professional advertisement
for the rest of your life.
</p>

<p>
A resume says very little about you.  A web site full of past projects
and articles about technical topics you excel at says a lot.  You
never know what's going to impress a potential employer.  Recruiters
won't read your web page, but really smart engineers will.  They may
think a project you've worked on was really challenging material.  It
says a lot more about you than a silly 15 minute interview.  Even if
you're not particularly brilliant, putting the effort in to set up a
web site tells people you're motivated and a self-starter.
</p>

<p>
Write articles about work you've done and opinions you have.  Promote
yourself on the internet.  Post links to your site on the resume
section in <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>.  Make
posts on slashdot and usenet groups.  You never know who might be
lurking there.
</p>

<p>
I have been told "I felt like I already knew you."  Isn't that a
wonderful thing to hear on an interview?  I also made a connection
with another employee when she mentioned that she had read some of
the things I had written and agreed with them.  When you hear these comments, you will
get a confidence boost like no other.  Your web site will make the
first impression.  Even if you go into an interview  sweaty and nervous, it's
OK, they already like you.
</p>

<hr />

<a name="expect"></a>
<p>The most frustrating thing I have experienced is being lied to and
ignored.  I have been told on interviews that I would be called back
within a day or two and then never heard back.  Once, I asked why I
didn't get a response and was told "my hiring options were frozen."
I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds a lot like the
professional version of "well, you're a nice guy, but...".
</p>

<p>
On many other occasions I could get no response at all.  I called
and e-mailed the interviewer multiple times, only to be completely
ignored.  Why it's so difficult to send a quick e-mail explaining
that they aren't interested is beyond me.  On some rare occasions, the
employer will show some professionalism and call you back.  But don't
count on getting that phone call.  Just assume they found someone
else.
</p>

<p>
I have also found that potential employers will make all kinds of
strange assumptions about you.  If they see Java and JSP on your
resume, they'll assume you want to be a web programmer.  If they see
masters in electrical engineering, they'll assume you want to do
whatever it is that they do there, even if your specialty has absolutely
nothing to do with their products.  Sometimes they'll just want an
engineer -- any engineer will do.  Only rarely will someone bother to
read your objectives and look at the course work you've done.  As soon
as you inform the interviewer of your interests, they'll disappear quickly if
it's not a match.  Perhaps most 22 - 23 year old graduates just lack
direction.  If you know what you want to do, finding work will be more
difficult.
</p>

<hr />

<a name="viewsite"></a>
<p>I promote my skills, not just with my resume, but with my web site.
This works really great if someone intelligent and technical finds
your site.  Unfortunately, it's usually recruiters or HR who do the
initial review.  And they often do not know what they're doing and
will not take the time to understand your abilities.  I have found
that some companies have one or two permanent, good HR people.  But
this isn't true in general.  Furthermore, if you have a very specific
set of skills, even other highly educated engineers may have a
difficult time understanding your skills and interests.  Obviously,
you cannot expect a recruiter to understand.
</p>
<p>
You will have to find ways to deal with these problems.  I have asked
recruiters to look at my web site and show it to their clients over
and over again.  They will not do it.  I have been asked for a more in
depth resume.  I have had recruiters ask me if they can add to my
resume so that it will appeal to their clients.  There is more than
enough content on my web site to demonstrate my skill.
Unfortunately, that does no good unless someone important sees it.
</p>

<p>
I suggest you just keep promoting your site.  If they ask for a resume
with more content, make sure you put a link to your site on it.  Add
links to specific pages you want them to see.  Many
people lie on their resumes to get a job.  Obviously, I do not
recommend this.  But it's ok to put every single technology you've
ever used on there as long as you represent yourself accurately during the
interview.  That is, if they ask about your experience with X, tell
them exactly what you know.  I have chosen not to fill my resume with buzzwords,
simply because it would make my resume three pages long.  However, many managers
prefer those buzzwords along with detailed descriptions of your
previous work responsibilities.
</p>

<hr />

<a name="testing"></a>
<p>One of the first things I tried was testing the waters to see what the
true job market was like.  You hear everyday about how hard it is to
find technical people.  Is it true?  Here are my results.  You decide.
</p>

<p>
I wrote a generic cover letter and sent hundreds of resumes out on
craigslist to the Washington DC area, New York, and the Bay area.  The
total number was probably around a thousand.  I got virtually no
response whatsoever from the first two locations.  I did get a handful of replies
from the Bay area.  I estimate my number of requests for interviews to
be at about 1%.  Keep in mind, this was just for an interview, not an offer.
</p>

<p>
Now you've seen my <a href="../../resume/resume_page.html">resume</a>.
I'm not a superstar, but I'm no slacker either.  What's going on here?
 The truth is, no matter how hard you worked in school, unless you
have a lot of experience in a very specific area, you just aren't
worth money to a company.  There are a million other brilliant
engineers just like you that can fill that job.  And many employers
will wait a very long time to get the person they want.  They're not
really as desperate as they make themselves out to be.
</p>

<p>
How many times have you sent out a resume, only to get back a response a
month or two later?  This happens to me often.  Those companies have a
long list of applicants to go through.  They can afford to neglect
you.  If they really needed you, they would call the day you sent them
a resume.  They know you'll still be unemployed when they get around
to contacting you.
</p>

<p>
My experiment brings up another issue.  You can't just get on
Craigslist or monster or any other job board and send out a few
resumes.  Trust me, it will not work.  I have gone on monster many times
and applied to dozens or hundreds of jobs only to get little or no
response.  You need to apply to everything.  If the thought of that
makes you uneasy, just remember, you absolutely have to do what works.  If only
1% of employers out there have an interest in you, you need to apply
to 100 jobs to get a response.
</p>

<p>
I once tried an experiment on craigslist where I sent a resume with a
link to a web site I was working on as sort of my work portfolio.  Only one
of at least a half-dozen recipients even bothered to click that link.  And
he only spent about two seconds on the site.  You know what that
means.  Most of those e-mails you send out are being totally ignored.
They are not being read at all.  They may be getting completely lost
amongst the hundreds of others in some recruiter's inbox.  Apply to everything.
</p>

<hr />

<a name="mail"></a>
<p>Before leaving Indiana, I decided I wanted to already have some interviews
lined up when I arrived in RTP.  So I went online and found over a
<a href="rtpcompanies.txt">hundred companies in the area</a>.  I wrote a nice generic
cover letter, bought special resume paper at the school book store,
and got some nice large 9x12 envelopes.
</p>

<p>
It took a long time to copy down all those addresses and seal the
envelopes.  And it cost quite a bit too.  But it was worth it.  Almost
immediately upon arriving in the RTP area, I was getting responses.  I
got around 5 responses and landed an interview at Cisys.  I highly
suggest you try this at least once.  If you send out enough resumes,
you will get responses.  There is a reason spammers send junk to
everyone, even though they know almost nobody wants it.  It works!  But
you don't need to spam 50 million people.  You're sending resumes to a
highly targeted audience.  A handful of those employers will be glad
to see your resume in their mail Monday morning.
</p>

<p>
Here's another tip: keep sending.  I sent a resume by mail to Redhat
twice.  I applied for positions on their web site and on monster.
Eventually I did get a response, and they asked for an interview.
Imagine this.  You mail a resume to your dream company. The new HR
intern was in a crappy mood and ripped it up.  Then she laughed about
it with her friends that evening.  The second time you sent in a
resume, it got stuck to the back of someone else's resume and ended up in the
trash without ever being seen.  The third time it was lost in the
mail.  The fourth time an engineer happened to see it sitting there
and was ecstatic.  Where has this guy been?  We've been looking for
someone like this for half a year!  The moral of the story is this:
keep sending.  Send weekly.  Until you get a response, there is no
reason you shouldn't keep sending.
</p>

<hr />

<a name="phone"></a>
<p>
One thing I absolutely hate doing is making phone calls.  Cold calls
are a nightmare.  But that's exactly what I did when I first got
here.  I picked up the phone book and started calling local software
companies.  Ultimately, I made several dozen calls and came up more or
less empty handed.  If you're going to do this, you really need to
call absolutely everyone.  That is, you should probably be working
your way through a few phone book pages a day.
</p>

<p>
I did have some interesting experiences, however.  I found that some
people were very helpful.  They made suggestions, gave me some of
their contacts, and accepted my resume.  Other people were a little
rude but most weren't.  One serious problem I had was with numbers
being wrong in the phone book.  Many of the numbers were completely
invalid.  A few of them ended up being personal residences.  Sometimes
I was redirected to a number out of the local area.  I had been told
on an interview that many of the companies around here went under
after the bubble.  That may have been the problem.  One man told me
that the entire software industry in RTP has been hell since the war
started.  On the other hand, I have also been told that it's hard to
find programmers in the RTP area.  Who's telling the truth.  Once
again, I'll let you decide based on your own experiences.
</p>


<hr />

<a name="parttime"></a>
<p>When I first arrived in RTP, I was only looking for part-time work.  I
learned the hard way, that it's nearly impossibly to find a part-time
job that pays anything.  I thought Cisys was going to offer me some part-time work at a decently hourly rate.  But it turned out they just
didn't have enough work (or so they said).
</p>

<p>
I also learned that once you tell someone you're only looking for a
part-time position, they won't take you seriously if you later change
your mind.  So be careful!
</p>

<hr />
<a name="craigslist"></a>
<p>I have a theory that it's hard to get responses on craigslist because
employers are tired of seeing the same old boring cover letters and
resumes.  I decided to try something a little different.  Below are
responses to three e-mails I sent (with names stripped for obvious
reasons).  I consider two of them to be a success.  One got me a phone
interview.  What is absolutely amazing is that I estimate my response
rate was at least ten to thirty times greater than usual.

</p>

<p>
I probably should have worded that better.  And I don't recommend
saying anything that might offend an entire small company.  There were
also a few other e-mails that were probably a little too aggressive.
But you never know what's going to get you a response.  If you're
going to say anything that could be insulting, use self-deprecation.
Use humor too.  Just remember, no response, no job.
</p>


<p><span class="bold">*</span>Apparently zero-defect software doesn't mean <a
href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.220229.28">no
bugs</a>.  I don't quite understand what it means.  This was the first
time I had heard of such a thing, and frankly I think it smacks of
arrogance.  It's also irresponsible.  If you didn't know anything
about software, and someone told you that you were getting zero-defect
software, what would you think?  However, I still applaud the effort to achieve such a
goal.  I can't stress enough how difficult this is.  The discipline and
maturity involved is attained by few.
</p>

<p><span class="bold">+</span>Be careful what you say by e-mail.  I've read that as much as half
(or more) of all e-mail is misinterpreted by the receiving end.
Because your expressions and emotions can't be read, the reader is
relying only on the words and <span class="italics">his</span>
emotional state.
</p>


<a name="techinter"></a>
<p>While I've never been asked anything truly difficult on an interview,
some of the technical questions can be quite hard given that they want
you to answer them right there on the interview.  It's hard to say whether they want
you to be both smart and fast or just if they just don't realize not
everyone can solve problems quickly.  In any case, you need to be
ready.
</p>

<p>
Most of my interviews actually weren't technical.  Rincon asked me
some DSP theory questions.  Bose asked me one very involved
engineering/problem solving question.  Amazon asked data structures,
algorithms, and design problems.  Some of this is just silliness.  If
you were really interested in getting in, you could just buy the book
and memorize the answers.  But you'll still get asked things you don't
know the answer too, meaning you'll have to figure it out right there,
which isn't fun.  So you better study.
</p>


<hr />
<a name="amazon"></a>
<h4>My Amazon Experience</h4>

<p>
Out of the blue I got an e-mail from a lady (call her S) who asked if I
wanted to interview with Amazon.  I told S I had no interest in going
to Seattle.  For the rest of the day I kept looking back at her e-mail
with its enthusiastic comments about me.
</p>

<p>
>Given your strong academic background, your interesting project
experience, as well<br />
>as the object oriented design and implementation experience that you bring to the table, I<br />
>do think that you could offer valuable insight to the folks already working at Amazon.com.<br />
</p>

<p>
Well, I had already turned
down Bloomberg and Redhat for an interview.  I figured the stupidity
has to stop.  So I e-mailed S back and basically said sure, why not.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I wasn't aware that Amazon ranks up there with
Microsoft and Google in terms of quality of work, smart people, and
good pay.  I had actually once sent a resume to Google after finding a
job ad in CUJ.  It was rejected.  Never have I applied to work at
Microsoft.  (I've gotten myself in trouble for lack of ambition in the
past.)  I probably should have been
flattered that Amazon was coming to me for an interview, but  I just
wasn't aware of their reputation.  I wonder if the fact that I pretty
much blew them off at first came off as confidence or stupidity.
</p>

<p>
Now I still really didn't understand why S was interested in me.  I
was, after all, looking for a DSP job.  She cited my object oriented
design, interesting projects, strong academics, and my music
background*.  Perhaps they're just trying to interview as many smart
appearing candidates as possible.  She was persistent even through my lack of
enthusiasm.  And I bluntly told her I still wasn't sure about the
Seattle thing.
</p>

<p>
So I went to the interview, nervous as usual but no idea what I was
in for.  The first tip off that something was up came when the guy
sitting near me said he used to work at Microsoft.  It was becoming
apparent that this was not going to be an easy interview.  To make
matters worse, I wasn't terribly motivated, I've never had a technical
CS interview, I haven't done much data
structures type stuff in five years, and my school didn't really cover
it very well.  I actually learned most of what I know on my own in
high school, which was about nine years ago.  And some people really,
really <a href="http://blog.mattgoyer.com/technical-interview-at-amazon-sde-and-microsoft-program-manager">prepare</a> for these things.  Check <a href="http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/google-secret-weapon.html">this
one</a> out too.
</p>

<p>
The first guy I interviewed with was obviously extremely intelligent
and motivated.  In fact, he told me before Amazon, he had been working
90 hours a week on Wall Street.  After that interview, I got the
feeling they had already made their decision about me.  I had one
more interview with another very intelligent software engineer, which also
didn't go too well.  In fact, my implementation of <a href="listreverse/reverse.html">list reversal</a> was
so awkward, it took him a while to even grasp it.  After that they let
me go.  I'm pretty sure I was supposed to interview with several more
people, but it looked like they had already made a decision.
</p>
