<h1 class="topofpage">OOP with C</h1>
<p>
Now that you've seen how to make C object like, why don't we take it a
smidgen further?  Can it be made to do some kind of simple
inheritance?  I thought so.  So, I wrote a little demo <a
href="polymorph.c">program</a> to see if I could come up with
something.
</p><p>
The first thing I did was make a private variables structure that will be
put into the base class.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flkf">typedef</span> <span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">___pvt</span> {
    <span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">a</span>;
    <span class="fltf">char</span> <span class="flvnf">b</span>[10];
} <span class="flvnf">__pvt</span>;
</pre>

<p>
The reason it's a struct is so I can get the size of it, and use that
to pad the derived classes*.  That's done with a macro.  This must be
the first thing after the struct declaration.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flpf">#define</span> <span class="flvnf">BASE_OFFSET</span>           \
<span class="fltf">char</span> __offset[<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(__pvt)];
</pre>

<p>
Next, I'll need some public variables.  This doesn't need a struct.
It's going to be put in every class right after the private portion.
(And when I say class, really I mean struct.)
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flpf">#define</span> <span class="flvnf">PUB_VAR</span>                  \
<span class="fltf">char</span> c;                          \
<span class="fltf">void</span> (*<span class="flvnf">foo</span>);
</pre>

<p>
That's all you need.  Below is the base class with private variables
a and b and public variables c and foo.  Beneath that are two derived
classes.  They include the offset (which is where the private
variables are), followed by the public variables, and last is their
extension to the base class.  In this case I've defined an integer in
one class and a short in the other.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">base</span> {
    <span class="fltf">__pvt</span> <span class="flvnf">__pvt_var</span>;
    PUB_VAR;
};

<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">derived1</span> {
    BASE_OFFSET;
    PUB_VAR;
    <span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">a</span>;
};

<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">derived2</span> {
    BASE_OFFSET;
    PUB_VAR;
    <span class="fltf">short</span> <span class="flvnf">a</span>;
};
</pre>

<p>
There are three pointers to functions defined.  So I'm going to define
three functions to point to.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo_d1</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>* <span class="flvnf">d1</span>, <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">s</span>, <span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">i</span>)
{
    printf("<span class="flsf">Came from %s - %d\n</span>",s,i);
    printf("<span class="flsf">Member a is %d\n</span>",((<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">derived1</span> *)d1)-&gt;a);
}

<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo_d2</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>* <span class="flvnf">d2</span>, <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">s</span>, <span class="fltf">void</span> *<span class="flvnf">s2</span>)
{
    printf("<span class="flsf">Came from %s - %s\n</span>",s,(<span class="fltf">char</span> *)s2);
    printf("<span class="flsf">Member a is %d\n</span>",((<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">derived2</span> *)d2)-&gt;a);
}

<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>* <span class="flvnf">b</span>, <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">s</span>)
{
    printf("<span class="flsf">Came from %s\n</span>",s);
    printf("<span class="flsf">Member a is %d\n</span>",((<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">base</span> *)b)-&gt;__pvt_var.a);
}
</pre>

<p>
I can't assign these from within the classes.  It will have to be
done at initialization.  That's the first thing that happens in main.
I set foo of d1 (derived1) to point to foo_d1, and likewise for d2 and
b (base).
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">base</span> <span class="flvnf">b</span>, *<span class="flvnf">b1</span>, *<span class="flvnf">b2</span>;
<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">derived1</span> <span class="flvnf">d1</span>;
<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">derived2</span> <span class="flvnf">d2</span>;

d1.foo = &amp;foo_d1;
d2.foo = &amp;foo_d2;
b.foo = &amp;foo;
</pre>

<p>
Ok, make some assignments and print the results just to make sure
everything is accessible in the manner I think it is.
</p>
</td><td></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="2">
<pre class="code">
b.__pvt_var.a = 1;
strcpy(b.__pvt_var.b,"<span class="flsf">this is b</span>");
b.c = '<span class="flsf">b</span>';

d1.c = '<span class="flsf">1</span>';
d1.a = 2;

d2.c = '<span class="flsf">2</span>';
d2.a = 5;

printf("<span class="flsf">b.__pvt.a==%d\nb.__pvt.b==%s\nb.c==%c\n</span>",b.__pvt_var.a,b.__pvt_var.b,b.c);
printf("<span class="flsf">d1.c==%c\nd1.a==%d\n</span>",d1.c,d1.a);
printf("<span class="flsf">d2.c==%c\nd2.a==%d\n</span>",d2.c,d2.a);
</pre>

<pre>
And the results are

b.__pvt.a==1
b.__pvt.b==this is b
b.c==b
d1.c==1
d1.a==2
d2.c==2
d2.a==5

<p>
So it looks like b has access to its private parts.  The derived
classes are somewhat unaware of their private members.  Although, it
wouldn't be too much trouble to go ahead and access them anyway.  Next
up is the fun part.  I declare and point a base class at the
derived classes used above.  I can now (easily) assign the private
members of the derived classes using the base class pointer.
Normally, you woudn't be able to access a private variable outside its
class.  You could solve this problem by moving the structs into their
own files and leaving the definition of the structs out of the header
file.

b1 = (<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">base</span> *)&amp;d1;

And the output is

b1->__pvt.a==1

<p>
First invoke each of the derived classes functions.  And notice that I
pass the function a pointer to the struct that invoked it.  This would
be "self".  I should get the same results by using the base class
pointers.  Look mom -- polymorphism!  You can now pass the base class
pointers around without other code knowing or caring about the real type.
But when you invoke foo, you'll get the derived classes' behaviour.
And last I invoke base class's foo with the expected output.  There
are many obvious problems with this.  For example, the sub classes
can't call the super method of the base class (because it doesn't
exist).  But I think what I've done right here gives you some power.
And because it's all implemented in the code, it's quite transparent
and easy to grok in fullness.  Ask yourself this -- how well do you
understand what your C++ compiler is doing to your code?

not always work.  The compiler may pad after the inner struct.
However, if you had the definition of struct __pvt, you could just
include it in the base structures.
