<h1 class="topofpage">Memory Management in C</h1>

<p>
Two things that really drive me crazy when coding in C are how to
handle errors and memory management.  I want to discuss memory
management techniques.
</p><p>
When I first started working in C lifetimes ago, I didn't worry about
memory allocation too much.  I probably used fixed size allocation.
In fact, the thought of having to use a malloc probably scared the pants
off me.  But malloc isn't the only way to allocate memory, is it?
There's allocation that happens when you compile, and variable length
arrays and alloca (which are nearly the same thing).  Every time you
need to allocate some memory or call a function, you need to think
about these things.  Who is going to allocate the memory -- the caller
or the callee?  Is it going to be on the stack or the heap?  Who's
going to free it?  What kind of data structure will hold the memory?
How do you deal with freeing the memory when there's an error?
</p><p>
The very first thing that you should know is what not to do.  When you
write a function and allocate some memory on the stack, do not ever
keep a reference to that memory once the function goes out of scope.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flfnf">foo</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    <span class="fltf">char</span> <span class="flvnf">b</span>[]="<span class="flsf">hello world</span>";
    <span class="flkf">return</span> b;
}
</pre>

<p>
That string is on the stack.  When the function returns, you will have
a pointer to memory that isn't yours.  I had to do this a few times
before I learned this, and it still tempts me.  The trouble is,
introductory texts on programming don't tell you these things.  When
you're learning a language that's close to the hardware, it's
important to understand what's really going on.  So, what are your options
here?  You could try this.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flfnf">foo</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">b</span> = malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="fltf">char</span>)*(11+1));
    strcpy(b,"<span class="flsf">hello world</span>");
    <span class="flkf">return</span> b;
}
</pre>

<p>
This memory is ours until the process quits or calls free on it.  But
now the caller needs to free it.  It's also unsafe because I
didn't check to see if malloc returned NULL.  What if you need to
allocate memory for multiple variables?  You can't return multiple
pointers, but you might try this.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="fltf">void</span> <span class="flfnf">foo</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span> *<span class="flvnf">a</span>, <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">b</span>)
{
    *a = 10;
    strcpy(b,"<span class="flsf">hello world</span>");
}

<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">main</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    <span class="fltf">int</span> *<span class="flvnf">a</span>;
    <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">b</span>;
    
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(a=malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span>))))
	<span class="flkf">return</span> 1;
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(b=malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="fltf">char</span>)*(256))))
	<span class="flkf">return</span> 1; <span class="flcf">//a will be freed on return
</span>    foo(a,b);
    free(a); <span class="flcf">//just for demonstration
</span>    free(b);
    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
It seems less likely now that we would cause a memory leak since both
malloc and free are both called in the same function.  Of course,
there is still the opportunity.  Not to mention we have made the
higher level code ugly.  I would prefer to relegate the ugliness to
the lower level functions and keep the high level ones clean since
people might be reading and using them.  You might clean it up a
little.
</p>

<pre class="code">

<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">main</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    <span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flvnf">a</span>;
    <span class="fltf">char</span> <span class="flvnf">b</span>[256];
    
    foo(&amp;a,b);
    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Now that memory is on the stack.  But we can still use it in foo as it
remains valid until we exit from main.  There is nothing wrong with
this, but you have to be very careful about putting too much memory on
the stack.  You can request as much heap space as you want until the
OS tells you there is no more available.  You won't get a warning when
you run out of stack space.  And I believe programs are generally only
given a relatively small amount by default.  Not to mention you might
<span class="italics">accidentally</span> assign a pointer to that memory and later try to access
it when the function that allocated it has gone out of scope.  Of
course, you could always allocate the memory in the callee as I did
before if you're really determined.
</p> 

<pre class="code">
<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">foo</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span> **<span class="flvnf">a</span>, <span class="fltf">char</span> **<span class="flvnf">b</span>)
{
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(*a=malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span>))))
        <span class="flkf">return</span> -1;
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(*b=malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="fltf">char</span>)*(11+1))))
        <span class="flkf">return</span> -1;
    **a = 10;
    strcpy(*b,"<span class="flsf">hello world</span>");
    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
}

<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">main</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    <span class="fltf">int</span> *<span class="flvnf">a</span>;
    <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">b</span>;
    
    foo(&amp;a,&amp;b);
    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
What have I done here?  If you declare a pointer in the calling
function and allocate the memory there, you can access the memory that
is being pointed to in the callee.  But you can't change what the
pointer is pointing to in the callee.  This is what would happen if
you tried.

<p>
You see?  The b_callee pointer did not change the b_caller pointer.
All this did was allocate some memory for an integer and point
b_callee to it.  The pointer in the caller is still NULL.  You need
pointers to pointers.
</p>

char *b_caller=NULL&#59; //b_caller --> NULL
char **b_callee&#59;
b_callee = &amp;b_caller&#59; //b_callee -->  b_caller --> NULL

/* You now need to dereference b_callee everywhere it is used so that
you are referring to b_caller.  What you have after this statement is
//b_callee --> b_caller --> memory for integer 
Thus you have changed b_caller so that it no longer points to NULL. */
</pre>

<p>As another example look at it this way.</p>

<pre>
b_callee --> b_caller1 --> 100
</pre>

<p>I can change the number using either variable.</p>

<pre>
*b_caller1 = 99&#59;  //b_caller1 --> 99
**b_callee = 98&#59;  //b_caller1 --> 98
</pre>
</td><td></td></tr>

<p>
Or I could change what b_callee points to.  But that's not what we want.</p>

<pre>
b_callee --> b_caller1 --> 100
             b_caller2 --> 80

b_callee = &amp;b_caller2&#59;

b_callee -|   b_caller1 --> 100
          |-> b_caller2 --> 80 //**b_callee --> 80
</pre>

<p>
That was fun.  But we need to add another variable, c.  Oops, and
another, d.  Darn it, foo is used 97 times.  We now have a maintenance
nightmare.  What is needed is a data structure.  A carefully thought
out data structure will solve our problems.  And even a not carefully
thought out one will help a lot.  Let the code be a slave to the
data.  The data (and the interface) will dictate the structure of the code.
</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">foovar</span> {
    <span class="fltf">int</span> *<span class="flvnf">a</span>;
    <span class="fltf">char</span> *<span class="flvnf">b</span>;
};

<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">foovar</span> *<span class="flfnf">new_fv</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    <span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">foovar</span> *<span class="flvnf">self</span>;

    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(self=malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">foovar</span>))))
        <span class="flkf">return</span> <span class="flconstf">NULL</span>;
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(self-&gt;a=malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="fltf">int</span>))))
        <span class="flkf">return</span> <span class="flconstf">NULL</span>;
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(self-&gt;b=malloc(<span class="flkf">sizeof</span>(<span class="fltf">char</span>)*(11+1))))
        <span class="flkf">return</span> <span class="flconstf">NULL</span>;
    *(self-&gt;a) = 10;
    strcpy(self-&gt;b,"<span class="flsf">hello world</span>");
    <span class="flkf">return</span> self;
}

<span class="fltf">int</span> <span class="flfnf">main</span>(<span class="fltf">void</span>)
{
    <span class="flkf">struct</span> <span class="fltf">foovar</span> *<span class="flvnf">fv</span>;
    
    <span class="flkf">if</span>(!(fv=new_fv()))
        <span class="flkf">return</span> 1;
    printf("<span class="flsf">%d %s\n</span>",*(fv-&gt;a),fv-&gt;b);
    free_fv(fv); <span class="flcf">//frees a foovar
</span>    <span class="flkf">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
And now we have something reminiscent of object oriented code.
Notice, I can add c and d to the structure (object) without changing
anything else.  The memory allocation is all handled in one place.
The ugliness is hidden.  I didn't put lots of memory on the stack.
And you can easily write more functions that can be applied to struct
foovar.
</p>

<pre class="code">
fv = new_fv();
res = action1(fv);
res = action2(fv);
res = action3(fv);
free_fv();
</pre>

<p>
If you like, you can still pass a foovar to new_fv and have the memory
allocated this way.  You will still need to use pointers to pointers
unless you allocate the structure on the stack (which will be less
memory than allocating a and b on the stack).  But this will allow you
to return error codes from the functions.  Now you can do all sorts of
crazy things with foovar, like make it a hash table that can store
linked lists, trees, and hash tables of pointers to arrays.  And main
doesn't care about the memory allocation.  As far as it's concerned,
it might as well be using the simple malloc/free idiom.  The object
foovar handles its own memory allocation.  And this brings me to the
next topic.
