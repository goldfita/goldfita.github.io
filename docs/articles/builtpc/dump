## Description: Linux Kernel Crash Dump (LKCD) options

# Copyright 1999 Silicon Graphics, Inc. All rights reserved.
#
# This file contains the configuration variables for Linux kernel crash
# dumps.  The file should reside in /etc/sysconfig/dump, permissions
# set to 0644. 

## Type:        list(0,1)
## Default:     1
# DUMP_ACTIVE indicates whether the dump process is active or not.  If this
# variable is 0, the dump kernel process will not be activated.
#
DUMP_ACTIVE="1"

## Type:        string
## Default:     eth0
#
# DUMPDEV represents the name of the dump device.
#
# For local disk dumps, it is typically the primary swap partition on
# the local system, although any disk device can be used.  Please be
# EXTRA careful when defining this value, as one false slip can cause
# all kinds of problems. Currently, a link is created from /dev/vmdump
# to the first swap device; rename this to the exact device to dump to
# if that's what you want.
#
# For network dumps, it is the name of the interface used for sending
# the crash dump. Note that this needs to support polled operation.
#
DUMPDEV="/dev/vmdump"

## Type:        string
## Default:     /var/log/dump
#
# DUMPDIR is the location where crash dumps are saved.  In that
# directory, a file called 'bounds' will be created, which is
# the current index of the last crash dump saved.  The 'bounds'
# file will be updated with an incremented once a new crash dump or
# crash report is saved.
#
DUMPDIR="/var/log/dump"

## Type:        list(0,1,2,4,8)
## Default:     2
#
# DUMP_LEVEL has a number of possible values:
#
#     DUMP_NONE (0):  Do nothing, just return if called.
#   DUMP_HEADER (1):  Dump the dump header and first 128K bytes out.
#     DUMP_KERN (2):  Everything in DUMP_HEADER and kernel pages only.
#     DUMP_USED (4):  Everything except kernel free pages.
#      DUMP_ALL (8):  All memory.
#
# NOTE:  You must use the numeric value, not the name of the variable.
DUMP_LEVEL="8"

## Type:        integer(0:2)
## Default:     2
#
# DUMP_COMPRESS indicates which compression mechanism the kernel should
# attempt to use for compression -- the default is not to use dump
# compression unless someone specifically asks for it.
#
# The values for DUMP_COMPRESS are currently:
#
#   DUMP_COMPRESS_NONE(0):  Don't compress this dump.
#    DUMP_COMPRESS_RLE(1):  Use RLE compression.
#   DUMP_COMPRESS_GZIP(2):  Use GZIP compression.
#
DUMP_COMPRESS="2"

## Type:        list(0x80000000,0x80000001,0x40000000)
## Default:     0x40000000
#
# DUMP_FLAGS are the flag parameters to use when configuring system dumps.
#
#         DUMP_FLAGS_NONE(0x00000000):  No flags are required.
#   DUMP_FLAGS_NONDISRUPT(0x00000001):  Do not reboot after dumping;
#					continue running.
#     DUMP_FLAGS_DISKDUMP(0x80000000):  Dump target is a local block device.
#      DUMP_FLAGS_NETDUMP(0x40000000):  Dump target is a network device.
# 
# Valid combinations:
# DUMP_FLAGS_DISKDUMP - Disruptive diskdump
# DUMP_FLAGS_DISKDUMP|DUMP_FLAGS_NONDISRUTP - Non disruptive diskdump
#
# The below option is present only present with lkcd on 2.5 kernels. 
# DUMP_FLAGS_NETDUMP - Disruptive netdump
#
# DUMP_FLAGS_NONDISRUPT flag is not used in lkcd on 2.5 kernels. The dump
# will be non-disruptive if it is invoked from alt-sysrq key. In other
# panic cases, disruptive dumps will be taken.
#
# Note: DUMP_FLAGS must be specified as a hexadecimal number
#
DUMP_FLAGS="0x80000000"

## Type:        list(0,1)
## Default:     1
#
# DUMP_SAVE defines whether to save the memory image to disk or not.
# If the value is 1, the vmcore image is stored, and a crash report
# is created from the saved dump.  If it is not set to 1, only a crash
# report will be created, and the dump will not be saved.  This option
# can be used on systems that do not want their disk space consumed
# by large crash dump images.
#
DUMP_SAVE="1"

## Type:        integer
## Default:     5
#
# PANIC_TIMEOUT represents the timeout (in seconds) before reboot after a
# panic occurs.  Typically this is set to 0 on the system, which means the
# kernel sits and spins until someone resets the machine.  This is not the
# preferred action if we want to recover the dump after the reboot.
#
PANIC_TIMEOUT="5"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	10
#
# BOUNDS_LIMIT places a limit on the number of dumps that can be retained 
# in the /var/log/dump directory. Default value is 10. This implies after 
# dump.9, the next dump is stored as dump.0, replacing the existing file.
# Set this value to 0 if you do not want to limit the number of dumps.
#
BOUNDS_LIMIT=10

## Type:	string
## Default:     /boot/vmlinuz
#
# Kexec based softboot dump specific configuration variables (currently
# valid only for lkcd on 2.5 kernels)
#
# KEXEC_IMAGE is the kernel boot image in the /boot directory which
# needs to be booted after the dump. This will be picked by
# kexec as the next kernel to be softbooted. The next kernel
# can normally be the same kernel on which the dump occurs.
#
# Only relevant for dumping via kexec (present only in lkcd for 2.6 kernels)
KEXEC_IMAGE=/boot/kernel-2.6.15.1 #vmlinuz

## Type:	string
## Default:	"root console=tty0"
#
# KEXEC_CMDLINE command line arguments to the kernel(specified by
# KEXEC_IMAGE) which will be booted after the dump  This can
# normally be the output of /proc/cmdline.
#
# Note the value given here is only an example.
KEXEC_CMDLINE="root=/dev/md2 hda=scsi nmi_watchdog=2 console=ttyS0,57600 console=tty0"

## Type:	string
## Default:	192.168.100.1
#
# TARGET_HOST is the hostname/ip address of the target machine to which
# network dump needs to be sent. This target machine needs to be running
# netdump server application. The ip address should be in standard
# dotted format.
# TARGET_HOST _must_ be configured before netdump can be used.
# No default value is given here; the setting needs to be adapted 
# to the local network configuration.
TARGET_HOST=""

## Type:	integer
## Default:	6688
#
# TARGET_PORT is the port on which the netdump server in the TARGET_HOST 
# machine is listening for network dumps. Default is 6688.
#
TARGET_PORT=6688

## Type:	integer
## Default:	6688
#
# SOURCE_PORT is the port used on dumping machine to send dump data over
# the network. Default is 6688.
#
SOURCE_PORT=6688

## Type:	string
## Default:	ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
#
# ETH_ADDRESS is the ethernet address used by the dumping machine to send
# out the data packets. This should be specified in standard
# hex-digits-and-colons notation.
# By default, broadcast ethernet address is used which can increase
# the load on other systems in the same ethernet segment.
#
ETH_ADDRESS=ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
