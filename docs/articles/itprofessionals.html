<h1 class="topofpage">Intelligent Use of IT Professionals</h1>

<p>Although I enjoy working with software, I've never considered myself a
member of the IT field. One of the reasons for this is the sheer number of
technologies software engineers and their kin must learn. There are new
software technologies coming out daily at an ever accelerating rate. I prefer
to learn theory and fundamentals and a small number of tools very well. If I
spend a few years learning advanced mathematical and computer science concepts
and a handful of languages (actually many more, but they change slowly), I have
useful knowledge which is not going to change or disappear overnight, or ever. </p>

<p>But there are many different kinds of software professionals with
varying skill sets and abilities. Some of us like to work at the
highest levels, needing only to understand what software does, and not
how it works or even how to program. Some of us are lower down, having
a basic understanding of what can be done with software but also
knowing a little bit about what's going on underneath. And some of us
prefer to work at the lowest level. That is, understand the core of
how a system works and being able to modify it if necessary. And of
course, I have met people who work effectively at all levels, but I
think that is rare. I prefer the lowest level, because if you
understand basic principles, it is easy to quickly learn how a system
functions without needing to know a lot about the specific technology,
its configuration, or how it works with other software at a high
level. But I have much respect for people who work at the other
end. It requires a lot of effort to build up the breadth of knowledge
needed to work with many different technologies (and even to be aware
of them in the first place). </p>

<p>Now, the point of all this - how to use highly skilled software
specialists.  I'm referring to the guys who know one or a few things
inside out and backwards - database administrator, system
administrator, network system engineer, software configurator. Many
of these guys were out of work when the bubble burst, either because
their job vanished, moved off shore, or because of H1B visas. It's
just impossible for one person to know a lot about every software
package and technology out there. And it's getting harder each
day. Some companies will require a list of skills a mile long that
most specialists don't have. Others will just have contract positions
and cycle through experts. And it gets worse. When some companies
succeed at cutting costs by only hiring who they need, when they need
them, other companies have to follow suite to compete. So now the
company servers are deteriorating while it seeks a new system
administrator, and the system administrator is out of work half the
year looking for a new short-term contract. (And who knows - maybe
he'll start consulting and charge three times as much.) A large
corporation may be able to keep a number of full time specialists busy
90 hours a week, but small companies may not be able to afford them at
all or only on contract.</p>

Instead of trying to make your understaffed programmers and database experts
into network engineers and system administrators, why not share the cost of
some experts with other local businesses? The pc industry made the change from
vertical to horizontal. Instead of trying to make a small number of people do
everything, hire specialists who can get things done quickly. If you can't
afford that six figure admin (who's going to just sit there half the year),
split the cost. Yes, taxes and payroll are going to be a pain, but would you
rather spend more on the engineers or more on the finance employees?
And this way, the employees don't have to spend all their time trying to keep
on top of a million different, ever changing, technologies - they can focus on
what they're good at. And the work is done by an expert - not an intern or a
newbie. </p>
