<p>
I prefer to use the Dvorak keyboard layout.  Unfortunately, Emacs control keys were designed for a 
Qwerty layout.  This is a frustrating problem.  Try typing C-x b (switch  buffers) or C-x C-f (open file) 
in Dvorak.  Your fingers will be all over the keyboard.  And the physical layout of my board is also 
Qwerty; so, when I look, I get really confused.  I tried to solve the problem by reverse mapping the control 
keys back to Qwerty.  Thus, normal typing would happen in Dvorak, but C-x b would become C-q x.  And 
C-x C-f would be C-q C-u.  Sounds good, right?
</p>

<p>
Not quite.  At first it seemed there was no way to <a href=
"http://groups.google.com/group/comp.emacs/browse_frm/thread/dc5361274e705316/852e4c8ec9cabbaf">
remap just the control characters</a>.  Someone suggested using psetf with global-key-binding.  I tried 
this and it seemed to work with some control sequences but not others.  I'll explain why later.  It 
also only worked with a single control character.  That is, C-t would work, but C-x b and C-x C-f would not.
</p>

<p>
The next suggestion was to try messing with key-translation-map.  It works like this
</p>

<pre class="code">
(define-key key-translation-map "\C-t" "\C-s")
</pre>

<p>
That will take C-t and turn it into C-s.  This obviously won't work if you type two control keys or a 
control key followed by a letter.  (I'm going to ignore more keys than that since I almost never use 
more than two.)  But luckily that last parameter can be a procedure.  It must have one argument (which 
always seems to be nil) and must return a string with the new control sequence.  So once again it's 
looking like this is possible.  I'll just use read-char-exclusive to read in the next character and construct
the new control sequence.  And this almost worked, but there's a gotcha.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I needed to do was create a hash table to map keys back to Qwerty.  An example of how to 
do this is shown below.  I thought I could use the same hash table to remap the control keys as well.  But 
it turns out you can't break apart "\C-t".  Emacs considers that a single character string.  So trying to concat 
"\C-" to "t" doesn't work.  I had to make another hash for control characters.  It wasn't until later I learned
you can use an alternative form like (kbd "C-t").  And this will let you concat "C-" to "t".
</p>

<pre class="code">
(setq dvorak->qwerty (make-hash-table :test 'equal))
(puthash "t" "y" dvorak->qwerty)
</pre>

<p>
Here's the trouble.  I mentioned before that certain control characters didn't seem to work.  It turns out, 
if you're not in Xwindows (console Emacs only), it's not possible to get certain control sequences.  Check 
<a href="http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-ascii.html">here</a>.  There are 32 control characters
in ASCII.  That's how many control characters are available to Emacs.  But there are more than 32 characters on 
the keyboard.  Go ahead.  Count.  It's OK.  Notice that C-. is not in there.  In order to map C-. back to 
its Qwerty equivalent, C-e, you would have to know when it was pressed.  Try the following code snippet
Type C-x C-e after the right parenthesis of each to execute.</p>

<pre class="code">
(equal ?\^. ?\^n)
(+ 0 ?\^.)
</pre>

<p>
The ?\^x syntax is for characters.  Do you see how they both map to 14?  So "\C-." was being seen by emacs 
as "\C-n" which explains why it wasn't working.  In addition, some other keys, like tab and backspace, were mapping 
to other control characters I needed which really goofed things up.  At this point I've somewhat gotten used to
the control keys in Dvorak; although, it is an ugly dance my fingers have to do on the keyboard to get there.  My options
at this point are to stick with Dvorak or to try and figure out how to capture all the control keys in Xwindows and 
use Dvorak in Xwindows and Qwerty in a console.  When my Xwindows is running and stable, this is normally what I would use.  For 
now I'm going to leave it as is.  You can find the code in mapback.el.txt on <a href="../freesoft/opensource.html">my free software
page</a> in my backup files.  It's named with .txt so emacs doesn't try and load it.  If you learn more please contact me.
