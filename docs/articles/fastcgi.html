<p>
<a href="http://www.fastcgi.com">FastCGI</a> is an extension to the
well known Common Gateway Interface (CGI).  CGI can be very slow
because it starts a new process for every incoming request.  FastCGI
keeps the process in memory and uses it to handle many requests.
</p>
<p>
I needed to write a simple Python FastCGI script which would be hosted
on Apache2.  The module for Apache is mod_fastcgi.  There are a few
dependencies for the fastcgi module, but I'm using gentoo; so, I just
needed to <span class="bold">emerge mod_fastcgi</span>.  The mistake I
made the first time was not including apache2 in my use variable.  If
you don't do that, you'll end up getting apache1.3 installed.
</p>
<p>
And that's it.  All you have to do now is make a few configuration
changes.  Take a look /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.  You need to add the
module.  I also commented out both cgi modules to be sure I'm not using them.
</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="flcf">#</span>
<span class="flcf"># CGI Modules</span>
<span class="flcf">#</span>
<span class="flcf"># These modules provide the ability to execute CGI Scripts.</span>
<span class="flcf">#</span>
<span class="flcf">#LoadModule cgi_module                    modules/mod_cgi.so</span>
<span class="flcf">#LoadModule cgid_module                   modules/mod_cgid.so</span>
<span class="flcf">########################### mine #######################</span>
<span class="flkf">LoadModule</span> fastcgi_module                modules/mod_fastcgi.so
<span class="flcf">########################################################</span>
</pre>

<p>
The first line tells Apache to check the time on the script and reload
it if it has changed.  You should only use this in development mode
because it will slow things down.  I'm not going to discuss everything
under directory because I'm not an Apache expert.  The * in the path
tells it to look at all directories under home.  The full directory of my
scripts would be /home/goldfita/www/fcgi-bin.  And the script name itself
should end in .fcgi.  The url to access the script is http://127.0.0.1/~goldfita/fcgi-bin/script.fcgi.
</p>

<pre class="code"><span class="flcf">######################## mine #############</span>
FastCgiConfig -autoUpdate
&lt;<span class="flfnf">IfModule</span> mod_fastcgi.c&gt;
  &lt;<span class="flfnf">Directory</span> "<span class="flsf">/home/*/www/fcgi-bin/</span>"&gt;
    <span class="flkf">AllowOverride</span> <span class="fltf">None</span>
    <span class="flkf">Options</span> <span class="fltf">ExecCGI</span>
    <span class="flkf">SetHandler</span> fastcgi-script
    <span class="flkf">AddHandler</span> fastcgi-script .fcgi
    <span class="flkf">Order</span> <span class="fltf">allow</span>,<span class="fltf">deny</span>
    <span class="flkf">Allow</span> <span class="fltf">from</span> <span class="fltf">all</span>
  &lt;/<span class="flfnf">Directory</span>&gt;
&lt;/<span class="flfnf">IfModule</span>&gt;
<span class="flcf">######################## mine #############</span>
</pre>

<p>
You might have noticed the www.  By default this is public_html, but
that's too long for me to type.  If you want to change it too, you'll also
have to modify it in UserDir and under directory in mod_userdir.c.
</p>

<p>
Add <span class="bold">-D USERDIR</span> to <span
class="bold">APACHE2_OPTS</span> in /etc/conf.d/apache2.  Download <a
href="http://alldunn.com/python/fcgi.py">fcgi.py</a> and put it in
your Python lib directory.  Note that there is an error in the
source.  The function request.out.write takes one argument, not
two.  There is a <a
href="http://mythic-beasts.com/support/topic_fastcgi.html">example</a>
as well to get you started.  You should be done.  Restart Apache.
