When I was an undergraduate, my professors sometimes liked to put that
extra question on the test to "separate the As from the Bs".
Sometimes it was a thinking question.  That's great for me because I
like to think (even though it can be hard to do in a short amount of
time on a test).  You had to go a little bit beyond what they taught you
in class to answer the question.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, they might make a mistake.  You might get a question
that requires you to think a little, but it doesn't depend on the
material as much as it should.  Those questions saved me on some
engineering tests.  I'm not as good at solving analog circuit problems
as I am at just thinking a little.
</p>

<p>
I'm also better at doing the math than some of the engineering
problems.  That's why when the special question is just a math
question, I often outperform the other engineers.  Professors love to
put a short linearity question on their tests.  I also love these
questions because if you understood linear algebra, they're free
points.
</p>

<p>
And so that brings me to the point of all this: learn math.  If
nothing else, study linear algebra.  You will get higher grades on
your engineering tests.  You will be able to answer the challenge
questions.
</p>

<p>
But more importantly, having a solid understanding of basic higher
level math will make you a more valuable engineer or scientist (depending on what
you're doing).  Specifically, learn linear algebra, numerical
analysis, probability, and statistics.  You don't need to know really
advanced linear algebra theorems or really advanced probability
techniques.  You just need a solid understanding of the basics.  All
of the advanced research papers you read (if you read them) will
assume an understanding of these things.  All of your advanced classes
will be easier if you understand basic math.
</p>

<p>
When sophomore year rolls around, and all your professors are going
over matrix multiplication and complex arithmetic for the twenty-third
time, you can gloat privately.  You know what the other students are
in for when the professor zips through basic linear algebra concepts
at ninety miles per hour later on during the course.  But you're not
worried.  You took linear algebra last semester.  On the test, you're
going to solve the challenge problem in 30 seconds.  They're going to
sweat for ten minutes.  Better start studying.
