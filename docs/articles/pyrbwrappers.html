<p>
Have you ever needed a part of your very high level code to run
faster?  What some developers don't realize is that you don't need to
write entire applications in a single language.  The overall framework
of large applications tends to be a considerable amount of work and
requires the least amount of CPU time.  It's often all those nasty
little features that require a lot of processing power.  The good news
is that you can write program in a scripting language and implement
some of the heavier features in a more efficient language.
</p>

<p>
There are a few advantages of this.  Development time is much much
shorter.  There will be far fewer bugs.  You can get a prototype
working quickly, and it will be easy to change.  You only have to work
in a lower level language for critical functions.  It's usually not
too difficult to write a single function in say, C.  Some other
advantages of wrapping low level modules in a high level language are:
</p>

<ul>
<li>low level machine access in a high level language</li>
<li>code reuse of the low level module</li>
<li>difficult code can be made easily accessible to others</li>
<li>access to features and libraries not supported by the scripting
language</li>
<li>learning the scripting language in depth</li>
</ul>

<p>
I want to cover a quick comparison of Ruby and Python extension
modules.  This isn't a tutorial; I'm only going over a few basic
points.  There are <a
href="http://drydock.python.net/crew/arcege/extwriting/pyext.html">Python</a>
and <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/ext_ruby.html">Ruby</a>
tutorials out there.
</p>

<p>
In Python, you start by including Python.h and writing an
initialization module <span class="bold">PyMODINIT_FUNC
initastman(void)</span>.  The name must start with 'init', and the
rest of the name is the name of the module.  In Ruby, you include
ruby.h and write a similar initialization function, <span
class="bold">void Init_rb_astman()</span>.  In this case, the function
starts with 'Init_' and the remaining text is the module name.  Be
careful; case matters in Ruby.  The first letter of the module is capitalized.
</p><p>
It gets more interesting after that.  Ruby extension modules tend to
look just like Ruby code, whereas Python extension modules have a bit
of overhead.  For example, you have to tell Python about your module
and class functions.

You also need some special structures.  Often when wrapping some
code or API, there is data that needs to persist between function
calls.  The first structure below is a wrapper for your variables.
Notice there is nothing in it except for the required PyObject_HEAD
and the struct from my code.  I could have put anything I wanted in
there, but I didn't need to because I already organized my data neatly
into conn.
</p>

<p>
The next structure tells Python about all the special functions
classes can implement such as __str__, __call__, a destructor, etc.
You'll have to implement __getattr__, which should at a minimum lookup
the function in the astman_methods array above.  Fortunately, I
only had to implement a few of functions; so, it's not too much work
if you're just doing something simple.

<p>
Python also requires you to call Py_INCREF whenever you create or
reference an object (even if you're just returning None).  Ruby takes
a different approach to garbage collection; so, you don't need to
worry about incrementing or decrementing references.  In Python, if
an exception is raised, the extension function is responsible for
returning NULL.  In Ruby, exceptions longjmp out of the code.  This
means all the work is handled for you.  It makes the C extension code look more
like Ruby code itself, and there's less room for mistakes.
</p>

<p>
Arguments are handled a little differently in each language.  Both
have self as the first parameter to the extension function.  Python
only has one addition parameter, args.  The function is responsible
for parsing the args tuple and checking for the correct number of
parameters.  You must tell Ruby how many parameters each function has
before the function is called.  Then you declare the function with
that number of parameters (plus one for self).
</p>

<p>
And last there is the issue of building the modules.  Both languages
have a special module for building modules.  The only issue I had
was the way you have tell Ruby about library functions.  You need to
specify each function individually.  This is irritating because if
you're building the library and the wrapper simultaneously, you have to
add a new line to the extensions file for each new library function.
Then you have to rebuild the make file before you can run make.
</p>

<p>
The following two snippets are the extension build files for Ruby and
Python respectively.  The comments specify how to execute the code.
In this case, the library is a static archive (.a).

These are the only two languages for which I have built extension
modules.  I know Java has native functions.  And Perl I would assume
lets you build extensions.  Matlab has <a href="codesim.html">mex functions</a>, which are
written in C.  If you ever feel you need to optimize a scripting
language, consider writing an extension module.  Or, on the other hand, if you
feel development will take too long in a language like C, try building
the frame of the application in a scripting language.  Combining
languages is a powerful way of dealing with tradeoffs like time vs efficiency.
