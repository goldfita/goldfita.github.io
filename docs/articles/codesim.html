<p>
Congratulations!  You researched all the best algorithms, picked the
most appropriate one, and even got it working in matlab.  Now, how are
you going to get it running in real time?  Code it up in C and try to
get it running on your DSP?  No!  You can pray all you want.  If
you've done anything worth doing, it's not going to work the first
time, the second time, or even the 327th time.</p>

<p>
The first thing you want do is build a mex file that can be run from
matlab.  Now, you could just recode the matlab simulation in C, but
this won't be very productive since you'll just have to rewrite the
code for real time.  Instead, write the code so it can be run from
both matlab and on your real time processor.  To give you an idea of
how it should be done, take a look at the matlab driver below.</p>

<pre class="code">
function out=testAGC(in)
BUFFER_COUNT=160;
s=size(in);
clear mex;

out=zeros(s(1),1);
for k=BUFFER_COUNT:BUFFER_COUNT:s(1)
   out(k-BUFFER_COUNT+1:k)=agc(in(k-BUFFER_COUNT+1:k,:));
end
clear mex;
</pre>

<p>
This script takes an input vector and runs the mex function agc on it
one frame at a time.  The clear mex statements are just to make sure
the file is reinitialized each time the experitment is performed.  AGC
stands for Automatic Gain Control, which is the example I'll use from
here on.  The code must operate on only a single (of just a fractions
of a second) buffer at a time.  Any differences between the matlab
code and the real time version can be dealt with using conditional
compilation.  Alternatively you may be able to just link in separate
files; although, I have not tried this.
</p>

<p>
Let's take a look at the algorithm.  (See the <a
					     href="http://www.rose-hulman.edu/~hoover/Lab4/EC581_L4.doc">explanation</a>.)</p>

<pre class="code">
void AGC(int *in, int *out)
{
    int i;
    float mag=0;

    for(i=0; i&lt;BUFSIZE; i++)
        mag += abs(in[i]);
    if(mag&gt;250*BUFSIZE) {
        for(i=0; i&#60;BUFSIZE; i++)
            out[i] = (int)(in[i]/(mag/500000));
    } else {
        for(i=0; i&#60;BUFSIZE; i++)
            out[i] = 0;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
This simple example sums up the magnitudes in the buffer and divides
by the constant scaled sum.  If the sum of magnitudes is too small
there is not much signal; so, just set the output to zero.  The rest
of the file is below.  By using some defines, it is easy to switch
between platforms.  Instead of a DSP, I'm using Asterisk as my real
time system.  The Asterisk code is not shown here.  (See <a
href="http://www.signalsguru.net/articles/astexample2/agc.c">agc.c</a>) 
The routine, mexFunction, which is surrounded by a
precompilation define, takes the input frame and converts it to an
integer array.  This is used as input to the agc function above.  The
output of agc then has to be converted back to double precision and
stored in a matlab vector.  The Asterisk code is surrounded by a
similar define and can call the very same agc function.  Thus, once
you verify the code in matlab (which should be relatively easy), there
will be little or no need to rewrite code.  It should work in most
environments as long as you use standard libraries.  Once you get your
algorithm working in both environments, any changes you make will
usually only have to be made once.</p>

<p>
In this very simple example, it's hard to see why conditional
compilation might be necessary.  But consider what happens when you
need to use optimized code that is specific to your platform.
Consider this snippet from my work:</p>

<tr><td colspan="2">
<pre class="code">
#if SYSTEM==MATLAB
    double *tmp;
    mxArray *lhs[1], *rhs[1];

    rhs[0]=mxCreateDoubleMatrix(BUFFER_COUNT*2,1,mxCOMPLEX);
    for(j=0; j&lt;4*BUFFER_COUNT; j+=2) {
        *(mxGetPr(rhs[0])+(j&gt;&gt;1))=in[j];
        *(mxGetPi(rhs[0])+(j&gt;&gt;1))=in[j+1];
    }
    mexCallMATLAB(1,lhs,1,rhs,"fft");
    for(j=0; j&lt;2*BUFFER_COUNT; j++) {
        scratch2[j&lt;&lt;1]=(float)*(mxGetPr(lhs[0])+j);
        tmp=mxGetPi(lhs[0]);
        scratch2[(j&lt;&lt;1)+1]=0;
        if(tmp!=NULL)
            scratch2[(j&lt;&lt;1)+1]=(float)*(tmp+j);

    mxDestroyArray(lhs[0]);
    mxDestroyArray(rhs[0]);
#elif SYSTEM==C6713
    DSPF_sp_fftSPxSP(FFTLEN,&amp;in[0],&amp;w[0],scratch2,brev,FFTPOW,0,FFTLEN);

<tr><td class="article">
<p>
I need to call an fft routine.  The matlab and C6713 versions are
clearly incompatible.  But I can keep the rest of my code the same by
using a precompiler condition.  Easy.  (A word of caution here - When
using mxGetPi, make sure you check for NULL.  You will save yourself a
lot of pain trying to figure out why matlab is crashing since it
doesn't allocate the imaginary vector when it's not needed.)</p>
