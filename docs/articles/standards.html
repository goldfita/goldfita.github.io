Standards are everywhere.  The trouble is no one bothers to tell you.
When I was working at MusicRebellion, I wasn't aware that there were
publicly available documents on the Internet that describe exactly how
your browser should communicate with a server.  Need to know a little
about the HTML MIME type?  Just checkout the
Internet Engineering Task Force's (IETF) Request
For Comments (RFC) <a
href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2854.html">2854</a>.  HTTP?  Check
RFC <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html">2616</a>.

Perhaps you need to know how to implement an Echo Cancellation
algorithm that conforms to some standard.  One you can look at is the
International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) G.168 Echo Cancellation
standard.  It has guidelines on the rate of convergence and how many
decibels an echo canceller should converge to meet spec.  Another of
their standards is G.711 which describes a-law and mu-law codecs for
speech compression/decompression.  Another one is the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute's (ETSI) GSM, which specifies
both the codec and the signaling protocols.

If you work in C a lot, you might want to buy a copy of the <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/">ISO/IEC 9899</a> (C99)
standard.  Or you might just hang out on comp.lang.c and try to learn
that way.

I recently ran into a threading probelem.  I couldn't find a
solution to my problem given my current understanding of the pthread
model.  I posted to comp.programming.threading.  Someone mentioned
that pthreads can be cancelled at certain cancellation points
specified by the POSIX standard.  If you want to find out which
functions are gauranteed to have cancellation points, go on over to
opengroup, and have a look at the <a
href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/xsh_chap02_09.html#tag_02_09_05_02">cancellation
point</a> section of the POSIX standard IEEE Std 1003.1.
