<h1 class="topofpage">Commercialized Internet</h1>

<p>
Do you remember the old internet advertising scheme?  The first time I
came across it, I thought it was pretty neat.  You download this
program.  It shows you ads, and in return you get either money or some
free service such as internet (so you can watch more ads).  So I tried
it of course.  Within probably a few days or so I was sick of it.  But
it was already too late.  My brother had caught on.  The next thing I
know, the computer is bogged down with ad programs and fake
clickers. The useable screen size had shrunk to a quarter.
</p><p>
That was the old model. And even though he might have made some money
(at the expense of all of us), that model flopped.  I haven't heard
much about those programs in recent years.  I believe most or all the
companies went bankrupt.  Let's think about why for a minute.  You
have advertisers trying to cram useless ads down consumer's throats
who really have no interest in the products.  Both sides are trying to
make a little money at the expense of the other.  And it's just a
horrible model.  You can't make a living being a consumer.  It works
out badly for everyone.  And in the mean time, my hard disk is
grinding away churning out ads I don't want to see.
</p><p>
Since then, things have gotten better and worse.  For a while, web
pages got really vicious and started forcing you to look at banner
ads, hijacking the content for about 30 seconds or so.  Either most of
this has gone away, or popup blockers have defeated them.  And then of
course there is the adware/malware phenomenon.  What, you don't want
to be paid to watch ads?  Ok, we'll just force them onto your
computer.  But there is good to complement the evil.  And that is
Google adsense - the only ads I have ever (voluntarily without being
tricked) clicked on.  And I have actually found some of them to be
helpful.  I actually go looking for the content that's being
advertised.  Targeted advertising - at last!  
</p><p>
See, Google takes the opposite approach.  Be nice to the web surfer.
Keep the ads small and out of harm's way.  And surprise, surprise, it
works.  And think about this new wonderful model they've created.
Instead of encouraging people to rot their brains on ads, everyone now
wants to be a producer.  Do a Google search for <a
href="http://www.Google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=make+money+with+adsense&amp;btnG=Google+Search">make
money with adsense</a>.  It's all over the internet.  Post <span
class="underline">useful</span> content to your website and make
money.  Unfortunately, I think they have inadvertently created a big
<a href="http://www.adsensegold.com/">ugly</a> <a
href="http://www.wealthyaffiliate.com/">marketing</a> <a
href="http://www.mikes-marketing-tools.com/">monster</a> (should I
link to those?).  But that's ok. Whether those are scams or
legitimate, they cause far less distraction to the average user.  The
commercialization of the internet is actually promoting productivity
instead of the mindless consumption that was previously thrown at us.
</p><p>
Perhaps things have matured a little.  Maybe this is just another
advertising phase.  I don't know, but if things are different in five
more years, I hope they continue in this direction.  And without the
malware of course.
