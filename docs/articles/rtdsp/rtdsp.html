Journal</a> for publication, but the magazine was cancelled.  I wrote

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
Completing an Embedded Real-Time DSP project can be a rewarding
experience.  Researching algorithms to solve a problem through
implementing them on a DSP and verifying operation in a real
environment is quite a challenge.  As I worked through this process to
complete my degree, I learned some valuable development and testing
strategies.  For the remainder of the article, I will share my
experiences using the well-known Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm.
</p>

<h3>LMS Algorithm</h3>

<p>
A common problem with telephone calls is acoustic and electrical echo.
In the acoustic case, speech from the loud speaker of a hands free
phone reverberates through the room and feeds back into the
receiver. A good echo canceller will remove the signal and all
noticeable echoes, leaving only noise and speech from within the room
to pass through the receiver.  Knowing both the original speech and
the echoed version makes it possible to solve for a filter model of
the room.  The equations can be simplified and made adaptive,
resulting in the elegant LMS equations.
</p>

<img src="lms.bmp" alt="lms.bmp" />

<p>
The first step is a one-sample filter operation.  The second step
finds the error, which is the signal with the removed echo.  The last
step adapts the filter.  This set of equations is run for each new 
input sample, generating one new output sample.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Development Process</h3>

<p>
As you're researching algorithms, keep in mind time and memory
constraints of the processor.  Know the frequency, instructions per
cycle, on-chip memory size, and be familiar with optimized DSP
routines that have already been written.  Most DSP Algorithms can be
written almost entirely from basic building blocks such as the Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT), dot products, vector-scalar multiplies,
vector-scalar additions, and FIR and IIR filtering.  If you're able to
massage all of the important components of the algorithm into these
optimized routines, you can come appreciably close to the theoretical
computational limits that CPU makers love to advertise.  And the best
part is, there's no need to touch assembly.
</p>

<p>
Development of real-time embedded numerical algorithms requires a
disciplined approach.  If you fail to break up the implementation into
several carefully tested pieces, you may find yourself repeatedly in
the frustrating position of knowing neither how nor where to begin the
debug process.  Below I've laid out a suggested sequence to follow.
</p>
<p>
(1)  Research algorithms, DSP architecture and routines.<br />
(2a) Implement algorithm in MATLAB.<br />
(2b) Save test cases.<br />
(3a) Re-implement in a real-time format using a mex file.<br />
(3b) Compare against 2b.  (Generate new tests if necessary.)<br />
(4a) Port to the emulator.  Insert optimized routines.<br />
(4b) Compare against 3b.<br />
(5)  Test on DSP.<br />
(6a) If necessary, re-implement in fixed-point.<br />
(6b) Compare against 4b. Generate fixed-point tests.<br />
(7a) If necessary, re-implement in assembly.<br />
(7b) Compare against 6b.<br />
(8)  Test on DSP.<br />
</p>

<p>
If there's any chance your algorithm or code will change based on the
results of real-time tests, you'll want to make these changes in steps
one to five.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>MATLAB</h3>

<p>
Listing 1 below shows the MATLAB driver for the LMS code.  It first
allocates space for temporary and output arrays.  Then it reads the
MATLAB native double arrays into the buffers to be processed,
converting to single precision on the way.  It's important to use the
same types in MATLAB and on the DSP wherever possible.  This makes it
easy to compare the two, and it also lets you use the same code on
both targets.  The reduceEcho function runs LMS over the entire buffer
and leaves the results in errorFLT.  The next statement calculates the
start address of the next buffer.  I'll explain this after you see the
LMS code.

					       input(k-BUFFER_COUNT+1:k,:),c);
end
</pre>

<p>
The MATLAB wrapper in listing 2 below reads the signal one buffer at a time
from a MATLAB array and runs LMS.  In the real-time version, the
processor would be interrupted every time the buffer were filled with
new samples.  I have allocated space for the filter at the MATLAB
level because it's easier to initialize it here then deal with
initialization in a mex file.  And even though it's not used for echo
cancellation, another application may require it.  One thing to notice
is the length of the buffer.  A short buffer will lead to greater loop
overhead and more processor interrupts.  A long buffer requires more
memory and increases latency.  I have chosen 256 samples with the
assumption that the sample rate is 8000 samples per second.  This
would not cause a noticeable delay in the output, and each second is
broken into only about 31 frames to process.

<h3>LMS Implementation</h3>

<p>
The code in listing 3 is a straight forward implementation of the LMS
equations except that the filter is reversed to save on index
calculations.  The restrict qualifier tells the optimizing compiler
that none of the memory spaces of these pointers overlap.  The
outermost loop runs LMS 256 times, generating 256 samples with echo
hopefully removed.  The expression in the index of reference is quite
ugly, but if the compiler is doing its job right, it should remove
invariants from the loop.

<p>
Now things get tricky.  There is a problem with finding the correct
index into the reference buffer.  The filter is four times the length
of the input buffer.  This means it's necessary to store the last
three frames of input.  The unexplained statement in listing 1
calculates which of the four consecutive frames the newest samples are
read into.  And as if that weren't ugly enough, the array addressing
is circular.  This is a common theme in DSP.  It means the start and
end of the array are actually located right next to each other instead
of at the beginning and end of the array.  At each sample, I take the
dot product of the filter and the reference signal.  On the next
iteration, the starting point is incremented one sample in the
reference array.  The oldest samples are actually located just before
the start of the current buffer, not at the end of the array.  And
before the algorithm runs again, the old samples will be overwritten
with new ones.
</p>

<p>
There still needs to be a way to calculate the circular addresses.
One way is to simply use an if statement on the index, and wrap to the
beginning after the last element.  That might produce ugly code.  If
all your buffers are powers of two and your processor supports it, you
can use a circular addressing register.  If that doesn't appeal to
you, the same result is achievable by taking the bitwise AND with the
buffer size minus one.  That is what I have done here.
</p>

<h3>First Revision</h3>

<p>
Once the code is working and verified, replace the c-coded common DSP
routines with the optimized ones.  Sometimes this is easy and
sometimes it's not.  Because I forgot to do my homework at step 1 of
the suggested development sequence, I didn't find out until 4a that
this example would be more work than I planned.  My code did not meet
the assumptions of the dot product routine.  Fortunately I only had to
make some modifications for it to work with my code.  The function
requires both arrays to be aligned on eight bytes.  This is not an
option because the dot product has to start at every sample, and
samples are only separated by four bytes.  So I made a second routine
which requires the first array to be eight byte aligned but shifted
four bytes.  This routine has the extra requirement that the arrays
have lengths of multiples of four.  I just padded the ends of the
arrays with zeros so the result will always come out right.
</p>

<p>
The code in listing 4 breaks the dot product up into two cases.  If
the dot product starts at an even sample in reference, use the
original function; otherwise, use mine.  Each of these two cases is
broken into two further cases.  This is because the optimized
functions don't use circular addressing.  So the loops have been
split.  The remaining new code just finds the start index and dot
product length.

Table 1 compares compiler optimizations of the algorithm to using the
optimized functions.  Even for such a simple function, there is a
significant speed up.  This isn't the whole story, however.  The
compiler generates detailed output of its optimizations.  It even
tells you a little about how it did the optimization.  You can use
that information in combination with special pragma directives to help
the compiler optimize your loops.
</p>

*This does not consider loop overhead and code length.
</pre>

<p>
Fortunately, I did do my homework at steps 3b and 4b.  After a number
of attempts to get the modified dot product routine working and the
index calculations correct, it was immediately obvious when I did it
correctly.  The error between tests came up zero and I knew I was
ready to move on.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Intrinsics</h3>

<p>
Suppose instead of using LMS, I had chosen to implement the Normalized
LMS.  This algorithm requires a division each time the filter is
updated.  If your processor doesn't have division, this could mean an
expensive software routine.  And even worse, it will ruin software
pipelining.  The c6000 series has such a problem, but it also has an
inverse approximation instruction, RCPSP.  Using RCPSP with two short
iterations of Newton-Rhapson you can get the true inverse.  You can
gain access to this instruction using what's known as instrinsics.
These are just special c level functions that tell the compiler to
insert the assembly instruction you want.  For my work, I made
separate INVERSE macros for the MATLAB and DSP targets.  That way I
get normal division in the mex file and the intrinsic version on the
DSP target.  Intrinsics are one more option you have for controlling
what goes on at the assembly level without actually having to write
assembly.
</p>

<hr />
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Know your processor and your algorithms.  Start with high level code
first, and work your way down to the assembly level.  Use optimized
DSP routines wherever possible.  If that fails, you can use special
directives to help the compiler optimize your code.  Resort to
assembly only when it becomes absolutely necessary.  Generate
verification tests at each stage of development.  By following these
steps, when something goes wrong, you'll have some assurance that it's
an electonics or acoustics problem and hopefully not your code.
