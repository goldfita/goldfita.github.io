<p>
If you're at all like me, your debugging process is completely
undisciplined.  You throw in a few print statements when you need to
figure out what's wrong.  Then you delete them, only to add
them again later.  There are accepted methods of handling debugging.  If
you've ever peaked inside an open source project, you've probably seen
a bit of debug code.  Perhaps you're familiar with loggers and you've
seen console debug output.
</p>

<p>
Asterisk uses multiple levels of debugger output.  The more 'v's you
add to the start options, the more debug output you get.  The log
statements usually look something like this.
</p>

<pre class="code">
ast_log(LOG_NOTICE, "debug argument - %s\n",arg);
ast_log(LOG_WARNING, "debug statement\n");
</pre>

<p>
These statements are scattered throughout the code base.  They will
execute depending on the debug level.  Although there will be some
performance penalty for having them in the production code, it won't
be significant as long as they aren't placed deep in a loop.  An
advantage of this is that your end users can use debug output to
troubleshoot.  And even if a technical person needs to do the
debugging, a carefully formatted string is often going to be more helpful
than a core dump.
</p>

<p>
If you don't want to keep debug statements in code, you have a few
options. You could just leave the print statements in and comment them
out.  Another trick I have seen is this.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#if 0
    foo();
    printf("%d\n",total);
#endif
</pre>

<p>
Then you just change one character when you want this code compiled
in.  You could also use an #ifdef and define the symbol only when
debugging.  This can be done from a makefile.
</p>

<p>
One trick that I have used is to conditionally compile a single line.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#if 0
#  define DEBUG(statement) statement
#else
#  define DEBUG(statement) 
#endif

DEBUG(log("log output %s\n", str));
</pre>

<p>
Again, 0 could be replaced with a symbol defined in a makefile.  And
the code will only be compiled in if the program is built in debug mode.
</p>

<p>
However you decide to handle debugging is fine.  But you should make a
conscious decision as to how it will be done, and try to stick with
it and be consistent.  It's a lot easier to change one symbol and
recompile than to re-type the same print statements every time a
problem comes up.
