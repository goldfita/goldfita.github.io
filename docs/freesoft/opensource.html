<p>
<a href="wordsplit.c">wordsplit</a><br />
<ul><li>
Split raw audio files where silence occurs, and optionally remove the
silence.  You can use a tool like <a
href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/Main/HomePage">sox</a> to convert to
and from raw format.</li></ul>


<a href="dhead.tgz">dumphead</a><br />
<ul><li>
Dump file headers to stdout in human readable form.  (Reading binary
files in emacs hexl-mode becomes tedious after a while.)  Also comes with demo Python/Ruby wrappers.  Here's a Tcl/Tk <a href="dh_shot.jpeg">screenshot</a>.</li></ul>

<a href="agc.scm">Snd AGC</a><br />
<ul><li>
This is a Guile script for use with the <a
href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/">Snd</a> audio
utility.  It demonstrates how to implement a DSP routine and make it
accessible via a GUI.</li></ul>

<a href="lkcdutils-7_alpha.ebuild">lkcdutils</a><br />
<ul><li>
I made this live ebuild for lkcdutils because I couldn't find one, and the
one in the portage tree was for an older version on a non-x86
architecture.
</li></ul>

<a href="goodfiles.sh">goodfiles</a><br />
<ul><li>
This is a shell file I use to backup my important system and
customization files.  It's relatively easy to change for your own
files.  Here are the <a href="myfiles.tgz">files</a>.  (This is really
a convenience for me.)
</li></ul>

<a href="buffer2xhtml.el">buffer2xhtml</a><br />
<ul><li>
This is a file to take your Xemacs buffer and make an xhtml file out
of it.  I didn't write this.  I just made a few changes so that it
works with xhtml/css.  It also uses the actual colors from the buffer.
</li></ul>

<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pyastman">Asterisk Manager</a><br />
<ul><li>
This is an Asterisk Manager Interface.  It's built as a static library
in C.  There are also Python and Ruby wrapper modules.
</li></ul>

<a href="api-tools.el">Api-Tools</a><br />
<ul><li>
This is a small Xemacs package to search for function prototypes and
definitions.  It can also prototype your C functions.
</li></ul>

<a href="agitest.tgz">FAGI Test Framework</a><br />
<ul><li>
This is a very simple testing framework for Fast AGI implementations.
It lets you set up basic fixtures for any number of test runs.  You
can also use it to load test your FAGI server.
</li></ul>
