<h3 class="underline">Individual Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="bold">Image Processing</span><br /> 
<a href="imageprocessing/lab4.htm">Lab 4</a> - 
<a href="img_proc_prj">FinalProject</a><br />
This lab demonstrates a number of useful basic image
processing techniques.  The final project shows the results of an algorithm used to detect vertex information.</p>
</li>


<li><p><span class="bold">Advanced Image Processing</span><br /> 
<a href="advimage/Lab1.html">Lab 1</a> - 
<a href="advimage/Lab2_1.html">Lab 2</a> - 
<a href="advimage/Lab3_1.html">Lab 3</a><br />
These are the results of some projects from my advanced
image processing class.</p></li>


<li><p>
<span class="bold">Electronic Music Synthesis</span><br /> 
<a href="music/lab6_1.html">Lab 6</a><br />
This is a demonstration of some frequency-additive music synthesis techniques.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Chaos</span><br />
<a href="phchaos/pendulums.zip">pendulums</a> [zip]<br />
This is a working model simulation of some pendulums.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Chaos and Fractals</span><br /> 
<a href="chaos/">fractals</a><br />
These are the results of some fractal projects.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Special Relativity</span><br /> 
<a href="relativity/drawGridCallback.m">drawGridCallback.m</a> - 
<a href="relativity/makegrid.m">makegrid.m</a><br />
I wrote a couple matlab scripts for generating space-time diagrams.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Technology Management</span><br /> 
<a href="asynch.pdf">Asynchronous Computing</a> [pdf]<br />
I wrote a paper about asynchronous chip design my Junior year.  Since I
wrote that paper, much of the interest has disappeared.  Multicore
appeared to come out of nowhere and solved many of the problems.  But
a <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/09/0016241">post</a> on slashdot reminded me about this paper.
</p></li>

<h3 class="underline">Group Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>
<span class="bold">DSP System Design</span><br />
<a href="DSPSystemDesign/Design.doc">DSP Fixed Point System Design</a> [doc]<br />
This is the write up of a project I did in my DSP System Design class.  The project was to simulate a fixed point, SSB communications system in matlab.<br />
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Algorithms and Program Design</span><br /> 
<a href="Pentominoes.zip">Pentominoes</a> [zip]<br/>
This is a little game we built in C++ for our final project.  The goal is to place the last piece.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Data Structures</span><br /> 
<a href="Concordance.zip">Concordance</a> [zip]<br />
This project was to write a concordance program in Java.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Computer Architecture I</span><br /> 
<a href="MiniMips.doc">MiniMips</a> [doc]<br />
We had to design and build a processor based off the Mips architecture.  The plan was to eventually implement our design in hardware, but we never made it that far.  This is our documentation.  (There are a lot of typos and grammatical
errors; it was a long and difficult project.)  One of the cool aspects of this project was that I spent a few days writing a (working) very bare bones assembler for testing purposes.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Computer Architecture II</span><br /> 
<a href="Transmeta%20Crusoe.doc">Crusoe</a> [doc] - <a href="Crusoe.ppt">Crusoe</a> [ppt]<br />
Instead of a project, we did a short research project on a new computer architecture.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Computer Graphics I</span><br /> 
<a href="bar.zip">Bar</a> [zip]<br />
Our final project in this class was to make a graphically appealing game or scene.  We went with a bar scene.
</p></li>

<li><p>
<span class="bold">Mathematics of Image Processing</span><br /> 
<a href="dct_midterm.doc">Image Compression</a> [doc]<br />
This was a take-home exam, two person midterm.  The project was basically
to implement image compression using the DCT, which is essentially how
jpeg image compression works.
</p></li>

<h3 class="underline">Older/Personal Projects</h3>
<ul><li><p>
This is a Dvorak keyboard typing <a href="keytutor/src/tmp/">tutor</a>
developed in JBuilder.  If you just want to take a look, here&#39;s a <a
href="keytutor/keyboardshot.bmp">screen shot</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>
This <a href="streamer">stock streamer</a> is a short
project based off an example in The Practice of Programming by <a
href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~bwk">Brian W. Kernighan</a> and <a
href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/~rob">Rob Pike</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>
Browse some older <a href="older_prj">projects</a> from high school.  
It seems I've lost the really old ones.</p></li>

<li><p>
Take a look at some sample <a href="JHUAPL_img">images</a>
from my high school internship at Johns Hopkins.  You're looking at the results of object
discrimination.
</p></li>

<li><p>Other projects, which may or may not be found above, are listed
here.  Most of these were done in high school (ages 14 to 18).
<ul>
<li><p>A single player, single computer spaceship game in
basic.</p></li>
<li><p>A "snake" game, which I was told was a lot like Tron, in
basic.</p></li>
<li><p>A checkers game in basic.</P></li>
<li><p>A simple Java game with realistic velocity and acceleration of
actors using a game framework.</p></li>
<li><p>A basic program to solve minimization/maximization problems given a system of
linear constraints (as I learned to do it in Algebra II).</p></li>
<li><p>A string library in C++ that also does extended precision integer
arithmetic.</p></li>
<li><p>A Mandelbrot set generator, with lots of pretty colors, in
C.  A simpler networked, parallel version of the Mandelbrot set generator
in C.</p></li>
<li><p>A C program to balance chemical equations.</p></li>
<li><p>A meta search engine in Java.</p></li>
<li><p>An implementation of Support Vector Machines (SMO specifically)
in Java.</p></li>
<li><p>A C program with a fancy windows GUI to convert a number in any
base from 2 to 36 to all other bases.</p></li>
<li><p>A slow Java program to find a formula for the summation of i^n
for any n.  A fast, recursive version of the same program.</p></li>
<li><p>A program to compute pi using the method derived from expanding a
taylor series of tangent.  A program to compute pi using a Monte Carlo
method.</p></li>
</ul></li>
