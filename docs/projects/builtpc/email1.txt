                                Hi, there is no way to ask a question about documentation on your site, so I've chosen the closest option.  I need document order # 681374-002.  (I'm looking for a pin-out diagram of J1 on the cabrillo backplane.)  I can't find it on the web site.  Can you please email it to me.  If intel helps me solve my problem, I'll be sure to include a link and put in a nice word when I write my article on this project.  Thank you.
