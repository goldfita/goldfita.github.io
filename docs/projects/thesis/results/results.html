The first image below was captured in a real-time environment.  The
speaker was placed in front of the array of seven microphones.  The
time delays were sent to matlab from the signal processor, and the
bearing lines were then plotted.  I also performed some echo
cancellation experiments.  The <a href="withecho.wav">first</a> is the
president in the near room and background noise coming from the far
room.  The <a href="withoutecho.wav">second</a> is the same setup but
with echo cancellation turned on.  The number of taps was 1024 with a
projection order of 16.  The <a href="withbeamforming.wav">last</a>
experiment is with beamforming turned on.  You should listen to all
three at the same volume.  The second image is a plot of Echo Return
Loss Enhancement (ERLE) for the speech segment "ah".  ERLE is a
measure of echo cancellation.  </p></td><td></td></tr>
