<h1 class="topofpage">TI DSPLIB Modifications</h1>
<p>
When I wrote this page, I didn't know yet that I wouldn't be able to
include the modified source.  I'm allowed to distribute the original.
But if I make any changes, I can only distribute object files or
executables.  So, I've removed the modified code.  You'll just have to
make do with the descriptions and the object files.  </p><p> While
working on my thesis, I modified a couple of TI's DSPLIB optimized
routines.  The first one was the cache optimized mixed radix IFFT
routine.  I modified it so that the output is divided by four.  This
was done so that I could do two FFTs and IFFTs <a
href="http://groups.google.ca/group/comp.dsp/browse_thread/thread/d722f9ca62eb4011/fc70e12944ab4745?q=first+trick+post&amp;rnum=1#fc70e12944ab4745">simultaneously</a>
by making use of the imaginary part of the time domain signal.  It
runs in the exact same number of cycles as the original.  </p><p> The
second routine I modified was the dot product function.  I'm going to
go over the original and then talk about my changes.  First notice
that the prototype requires a pointer to the first array, then a
pointer to the second, and then the length of the arrays.  The arrays
must be double word aligned.  Next take a look at the assignments.
The array length goes into A_cntarg (A6).  The first array is A_x
(A4), and the second is B_x (B4).  A_x0 and A_x1 are adjacent entries
in the array.  The same goes for B_x0 and B_x1.  The loop has been
unrolled so that at each pass, prod0 is the even product and prod1 is
the odd product.  They are stored as a running sum in sum0 and sum1.
</p><p> The first cycle moves A_cntarg into A_cnt, which will be the
counter.  The next instruction stores a one in B_cntodd if the count
is odd.  Otherwise it's a zero.  Then we enter the prolog.  Since LDDW
takes 5 cycles, we have to start loading data here.  The first two
elements of each array are loaded into A_x0 and A_x1 and B_x0 and
B_x1.  The counter is decremented.  This is done four more times.  The
conditional [A_cnt] is used in case there are only a few elements in
the array.  If there are, we don't want to execute any of this code.
Now, enter the loop.  At this point, the first two elements of the
array have been loaded and are ready for processing.  The loop kernel
loads another two elements which will be used five cycles later.  The
products are calculated and the sums totaled.  Then the branch is
executed and the counter decremented.  There are a few things to note.
The loads, branching, and counter decrement all have the [A_cnt]
conditional so that we don't execute these instructions when the end
of the array has been reached.  The branching needs to complete six
cycles early because it has five delay slots.  The multiply
instructions use both of the available cross paths.  The add
instructions aren't summing the current products.  Those won't be
available for four more cycles (three delay slots).  This means on the
first four cycles just sum zeros.  After that, the products are ready
from the first cycle for the loop.  That is, the sums lag the
multiplies by four cycles.  The loop runs one extra time, and the last
two products are discarded.  This is done so that the epilog works
correctly.  The three cycles after the loop sum the last three
products (excluding the one that is discarded).  Note that the last
sum doesn't actually sum if the number of elememnts are odd.  </p><p>
The remaining cycles of the epilog sum the partial sums in several
stages.  The final result is put into A_result.  The branch occurs
five cycles before the end of the routine.  It jumps back to the
address stored in B3.  </p><p> For my needs, the data cannot be
aligned on eight bytes.  I modified the routine so that the first
element of the first array starts at four bytes shifted from an eight
byte alignment.  The second array is eight byte aligned.  The number
of elements must be a multiple of four.  Or the end of the arrays can
be padded with zeros.

<p>
The loop is unrolled once more so I can get an extra instruction in.
This is necessary because the arrays are no longer aligned in memory.
I have to temporarily store the second element loaded from the first
array so that it can be used in the next iteration of the loop.
</p><p> The first cycle of the loop performs the branch.  It also
moves the second element, A_x1, into A_tmp.  The next cycle decrements
count by four.  It also again puts A_x1 in A_tmp.  This will be used
on the next cycle to multiply the first element of B, B_x0.  And A_x0
will be multiplied by B_x1.  </p><p> The prolog is similar to the
original.  But branches only happen every other instruction.  And cnt
isn't decremented on the last prolog cycle (or the loop would never
end).  The epilog drops one additional add cycle because this happens
inside the loop.  Also, the odd logic has been removed because I
require the input array size to be a multiple of four.</p>
